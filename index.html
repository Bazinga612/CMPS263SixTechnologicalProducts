<li><b>Objective</b>
<p>Global spending on consumer technology devices exceeded $1 trillion for the first time, according to the Consumer Electronics Association last year.
It is very important that customers make smart decisions in terms of buying electronics and since online shopping is in a rage these days,
Amazon Product Reviews matter because those reviews have a tremendous impact on how we make purchase decisions. 
But, the current reviews on Amazon are rated based on aggregated features and not on individual features of any product.
I propose to create a visualization for the customer based on individual features of the six technological products: 
cameras, laptops, mobilephone, tablets, TVs and video surveillances. I intend to visualize the features based on the sentiment analysis of each of the products and their individual features.</p>


<li><b>Data sources</b>
<p>Dataset:<a href="
http://times.cs.uiuc.edu/~wang296/Data/">University of Illinois-Urbana Champaign-Database and Information Systems Laboratory</a>

Six Categories of Amazon Product Reviews
<p>Details about the dataset: Six products: cameras, laptops, mobilephone, tablets, TVs and video surveillances</p>
Each of these six products have json files in the format :
{Reviews:[Title,Author,ReviewID,Overall,Content,ProductID]}
</p>

This visualization is not exactly what I intend to do, but it is similar as it is visualization of Amazon Reviews Data based on reviews and ratings.
