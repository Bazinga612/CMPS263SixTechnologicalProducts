<h2 id="titles"><p style="text-align:center;">Six Technological Products: What Do Buyers Care About?</h1>
</p><p style="text-align:center;">Global spending on consumer technology devices exceeded $1 trillion for the first time, according to the Consumer Electronics Association last year. It is very important that customers make smart decisions in terms of buying electronics and since online shopping is in a rage these days, Amazon Product Reviews matter because those reviews have a tremendous impact on how we make purchase decisions. But, the current reviews on Amazon are rated based on aggregated features and not on individual features of any product. I propose to create a visualization for recommending customers based on individual features of the six technological products: cameras, laptops, mobilephone, tablets, TVs and video surveillances. I intend to visualize the features based on the sentiment analysis of each of the products and their individual features.
