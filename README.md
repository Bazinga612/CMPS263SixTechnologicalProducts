# Objective
<p>
Global spending on consumer technology devices exceeded $1 trillion for the first time, according to the Consumer Electronics Association last year.
It is very important that customers make smart decisions in terms of buying electronics and since online shopping is in a rage these days,
Amazon Product Reviews matter because those reviews have a tremendous impact on how we make purchase decisions. 
But, the current reviews on Amazon are rated based on aggregated features and not on individual features of any product.
I propose to create a visualization for recommending customers based on individual features of the six technological products: 
cameras, laptops, mobilephone, tablets, TVs and video surveillances. I intend to visualize the features based on the sentiment analysis of each of the products and their individual features.

-[University of Illinois-Urbana Champaign-Database and Information Systems Laboratory](http://times.cs.uiuc.edu/~wang296/Data/)
<br>Six Categories of Amazon Product Reviews: cameras, laptops, mobilephone, tablets, TVs and video surveillances
<br>Each of these six products have json files in the format :

## Visualization sources
### From the previous UCSC classes of Visualization:

<br>Ashwini Patil Geetanjali Rakshit,CMPS 263: Data Driven Discovery and Visualization:Winter 2017, Prof. Suresh Lodha
I take inspiration from this project for visualization according to textual-sentiments

I take inspiration from this project for visualization according to each features of food here( features of individual electronic products in my case)

### From web:
[Amazon Reviews Data](http://minimaxir.com/2017/01/amazon-spark/)
<br>This visualization is not exactly what I intend to do, but it is similar as it is visualization of Amazon Reviews Data based on reviews and ratings.
