"Nook HD+ 9"" 16GB Wi-Fi Color Tablet","Excellent tablet for a Android device. The HD graphics are much better than any iPad for a fraction of the cost. It allows multiple logins so that you can have a separate profile for your kids that is locked down on the apps you want them to run, unlike an iPad. The display and memory options are fantastic I would buy another!",4
"Nook HD+ 9"" 16GB Wi-Fi Color Tablet","I used a few tablets since they have become mainstream and I can say that this tablet is a great middle-of-the-road tablet. I've had this tablet for about 4 days now and here is what I have found... The touch interface isn't quite as good as my iPad 3rd Gen, but it is better than most mid-range tablets and as good as some top rated tablets. CPU speed is a good mid-range also. PROS: +Full 1080P - 9"" display that really shows good images (movies and games look great on it) +Access to the Google Play Store (Amazon should take note) +MicroSD slot, up to 64GB card (I will in the near future put a bootable Android version on it) +Easy to copy my eBooks (or other files) from my home computer using ASTRO File Manager CONS: -No cameras (I wouldn't use it for photos, but video conferencing would have been nice). -No GPS (although if you turn on Google's Location Service it can get pretty close). -Proprietary USB charging port, makes it difficult to always keep it charged because you don't always carry the charging cable with you (and extra charging cables for the NOOK HD+ are expensive). -No sensor for ambient light to allow automatic screen brightness (this bothers me more than I thought it would). -WiFi connections can be flaky sometimes, but if you turn off the NOOK WiFi and turn it back on it seems to clear it up. -Mono speaker, but when stereo matters I am usually using headphones. -NOOK Profiles (up to 6), I thought this would be a PRO but their implementation only seems to give different 'tabletops', each user still uses the same programs and settings (such as the same screen unlock password), so my Jetpack Joyride game is the same as my kids and they keep spending my coins! ... :-/ -The screen is a fingerprint magnet (a screen protector should help this). -Can't load apps from 'Unknown Sources,' this is a pain because I have some apps I bought on the Amazon App Store and I can't load them. All-in-all I like it for what I got it for, some of its shortcomings are easily overlooked since I have a phone that can do the cameras and GPS. Worth the $150.",4
"Nook HD+ 9"" 16GB Wi-Fi Color Tablet","This tablet is amazing for running apps at home or using it as an e-reader. I was a little skeptical, considering the price, but it is a solid tablet. I originally bought it with the intent of rooting it, but even on the default Android OS, I am able to run everything i need from the google play store. Obviously gps, led, and camera functions don't work, but of course it was never designed for that. The kindle app works good which makes me wonder why anyone would get a different Android-based e-reader.",4
"Nook HD+ 9"" 16GB Wi-Fi Color Tablet",Don't know where to start. Bought brand new (supposedly- per ad) & started glitching almost immediately after purchase. Ironically within a couple days of return policy expiration...these 14 & 30 day return policies are absurd with how much the quality of electronics has decreased.,4
"Nook HD+ 9"" 16GB Wi-Fi Color Tablet",Good product for the price. Not an Apple I-pad but close. Biggest advantage is the ability to connect to a PC using the USB port. Not many tablets can do this and it is a huge advantage..,4
"Nook HD+ 9"" 16GB Wi-Fi Color Tablet",When i purchased this item i was to understand that it was new. When my son had a problem with the power cord and he called Barnes and Nobel we found out that it was in fact used. the warranty expired 10 days prior to the purchase! I called amazon and they are now sending me a new one! thank you amazon for making things right! =},4

"Motorola ET1 Business Tablet - Android Jellybean, Web Browser, 802.11a/b/g/n, Built-In Barcode Scanner Driver",This is a worst device I have ever had. I have this device for less than a year and had gone through the tech depot for repair at least four times with the se problem. Will not charge. For the past three times they are able to fix it and works for a few weeks then the problem come back. It spent more time shipping back and forth between tech depot and my office than it is being use. Just sent another email to tech support and waiting to see what they have to say. Update: I received the unit back from the Depot. This time the battery is discharged and will not accept any charges at all. Meaning they couldn't fix the problem and send back the broken one as it was. GREAT JOB Motorola Solution.. Another email and call will be out to their customer service....,3
"Motorola ET1 Business Tablet - Android Jellybean, Web Browser, 802.11a/b/g/n, Built-In Barcode Scanner Driver","Awesome product. Manageable, secure, with Multi-user capabilities, durable, etc. Great for retail and field applications. There are also additional accessories, like scanners and card readers available that will make it great for these apps.",3
"Motorola ET1 Business Tablet - Android Jellybean, Web Browser, 802.11a/b/g/n, Built-In Barcode Scanner Driver","Its a great enterprise option for tablets: replaceable battery, management, scanning, and durability are great. I recommend it for warehouse, retail, and T&L.",3
"NEC Versa LitePad Tablet PC (933-MHz Pentium III-M, 256 MB RAM, 20 GB Hard Drive, CD-ROM Drive)","I've been using the NEC Versa Litepad since it was first released several months ago, and it's a great machine. The word recog. software is probably about an 8 on a 10-point scale -- not as good as Transcriber on my iPAQ, but if I'm careful about penmanship, it is about 97% accurate (in fact, I wish I could load Transcriber -- would be easier and faster writing with better recognition). Battery life is very good -- I can take notes for well over two hours, and the larger stylus is easy to write with. It has a long cord from the AC adaptor that is mostly unobtrusive, so you can recharge and keep writing. Customers/clients don't mind the Tablet b/c it's slim and looks like a writing pad. Resolution is very good -- increasing font size and icons makes everything quite readable, especially when I'm writing quickly and trying to get speech verbatim. The keyboard is flimsy with poor key travel and spacing, but I rarely use it anyway -- I really use it as a ""glorified PDA"" mostly. Using a Compact Flash card is great for transferring data b/w machines. Comes with WiFi, but I haven't gone wireless yet. Plugging in a flash card with digital photos from my Canon automatically starts a slide show -- cool feature. Ethernet connection makes it easy to go online. The unit gets warm but not uncomfortable -- especially compared to Toshiba and Compaq's tablets. I'm getting 'burn in' in the lower part of the display -- bummer -- but it's not a big problem. Since I use it primarily for note-taking with clients, I haven't really put it through its paces or exploited all its capabilities, but I'm impressed so far overall and like it better than the other Tablet PCs I tried out (Toshiba, Acer, Compaq). I've also noticed that it takes less effort to write on a Tablet with stylus than with pen on notepad. I've owned two other NEC notebooks and always had good luck. Looks like they've produced another winner. It is pricey, but I notice it's already $700 cheaper than when I bought it when first released.",5
"NEC Versa LitePad Tablet PC (933-MHz Pentium III-M, 256 MB RAM, 20 GB Hard Drive, CD-ROM Drive)","As a PhD student, I spend a lot of time in the library and I need a light computer like this to carry with me while I look through books. This is perfect--since it's barely two pounds, you often forget that it's there. With the LitePad, my (now) hand-written notes, papers, and articles are easily within reach whenever I need them; there's no more wishing I had brought more papers with me from home and the like. My Palm used to fulfill a similar function, but I've stopped carrying it now that I have this. I was especially surprised by how accurate the note-to-text feature is: even though it's not perfect, it's still many times better than what we had before. With my handwriting at least, it has about a 90% accuracy rate (usually the words it misses are words in other languages, etc). This machine has changed my life for the better, and I whole-heartedly recommend it to anyone else in academia.",5
"NEC Versa LitePad Tablet PC (933-MHz Pentium III-M, 256 MB RAM, 20 GB Hard Drive, CD-ROM Drive)","This is the perfect product for any psychotherapist. Taking notes on this is so much better than using a pad. All of each patient's sessions are in one place. Easy to download to my zip drive. I highly recommend it to any therapist out there. The only drawbacks to this model are the battery life and the need to get every available Windows Update since the software that comes with the tablet is not current. If your chair is near an outlet, then you are really set to go.",5
"NEC Versa LitePad Tablet PC (933-MHz Pentium III-M, 256 MB RAM, 20 GB Hard Drive, CD-ROM Drive)","I have had this pc for about one month. I really like it. The handwriting recognition needs some improvement but its incredibly portable and with practice it is very functional. I use PowerPoint presentations and the addon pgm ""Ink"" is incredible. The high price will limit the acceptance of this type of pc.",5
"Toshiba PORTEGE M200 Tablet PC (1.5 GHz Pentium M, 512MB, 40GB Hard Drive)","I purchased this used laptop for a bit over $200 bucks. I wasn't expecting much. My Motion Tablet died and I needed a replacement. I had purchased the newest cutting edge Asus tablet and was sadly disappointed. This was a ""what the hell"" purchase and I am DELIGHTED!! The laptop is in excellent condition and what's more it does everything I wanted! Even though it uses Windows XP, I can surf and shop and chat and write letters and balance the checkbook. The pen and keyboard are both easy to use and in great shape. But there is more! I am a frustrated fan of MusicMatch and I wanted to be able to use that program to play my music But it only works with Windows XP. Since this laptop uses XP, I can use my beloved MusicMatch and link to my music on my pc and play music with bluetooth speakers anywhere in the house. Heaven! It's not just that the hardware seems to be in good shape, the installed programs are very helpful. What a smart little shopper I am!",3

"Toshiba PORTEGE M200 Tablet PC (1.5 GHz Pentium M, 512MB, 40GB Hard Drive)",Very bad crashed on me after two weeks....would not buy again.,3
"Toshiba PORTEGE M200 Tablet PC (1.5 GHz Pentium M, 512MB, 40GB Hard Drive)","This tablet is piece of Junk..... It does not have 1.5 mhz, 40GB hard drive and 5400 RPM, instead it has zero speed. I purchased this as a gift and I am so embarrassed. This was a Bait-and-Switch, which is illegal in United States. I am very disappointed in Amazon, this is the third item I purchased from Amazon that was not as advertised.",3
"Toshiba PORTEGE M200 Tablet PC (1.5 GHz Pentium M, 512MB, 40GB Hard Drive)","A great value for the price, this laptop is a gem in the vintage computing world. Not only do you have an amazingly-precise pressure-sensitive wacom painting device on your screen, but the screen itself is extremely high resolution and beautiful, despite the off-white beigish glow of 9 year old faded backlights. If you are a digital artist, then you probably already know how expensive it can be to obtain a wacom tablet embedded into a computer screen. For a used laptop that most people would overlook, you get that and more for a really great price. For a laptop from 2004, this thing is extremely high end- every part inside it is the best at what it does. For example, even though the sound on the laptop speakers is terrible, the internal amplifier outputs the best quality sound I have ever heard pumped into my Grado sr80 headphones. Music sounds great at full volume, and even better during the low volume parts. You don't see consumer grade laptops with sound as good as on this machine. I would have gladly paid $1500-$1700 for this machine back then if I had the money and knew about it at the time. Performance wise, this computer does well- the only thing it lacks is a proper video card for gaming, but at the price what do you expect? The construction of the external structure is extremely solid and doesn't feel hollow like low-end consumer grade laptops do. It's solid metal and feels like it can withstand a nuclear hollocaust. I installed both Windows 7 and the latest copy of Xubuntu, and am extremely pleased at how well the two OS's performed. Weightwise, this laptop isn't as heavy as you'd expect from something as solid as this. It is surprisingly light and feels comfortable in any position. This computer's flaws include the following: 1) Not being able to boot from a USB or external CD drive. You need to buy a special Toshiba drive that came along with this PC. Very frustrating. 2) SD card slot doesn't work, unless of course you're running XP and have installed custom drivers that aren't available on Linux nor windows 7 and up. 3) Online video feels glitchy on my linux installation, but I'm not sure why. 4) Buttons on the front of the swivel screen don't work in any non-XP environment. On the plus side though, the pen's side button and the erasor seem to be working perfectly fine in linux. 5) Screen is nowhere near as magnificent as today's glossy new OLED screens. Colors are fine even at angles, but the problem is that the backlights just aren't as bright anymore, and it costs money to replace them.",3
"Toshiba PORTEGE M200 Tablet PC (1.5 GHz Pentium M, 512MB, 40GB Hard Drive)","Pros: fast CPU, very configurable build options, convertible style means you can go ""laptop"" if you need to get serious data entry accomplished, built-in Ethernet and WiFi, SD card slot. Cons: price is real hefty, lacks some high-end options like fast-big HDD, no Firewire. This tablet is really the only true competitor to Fujitsu's long-time reign as tablet leader. It has a rich feature set, brilliant LCD display, and the processor power to exceed Fujitsu's latest offerings. Of course, the true utility in a tablet is the software, and Windows XP Tablet PC edition more than handles the job of capturing pen taps, clicks, and sketches (handwriting, lettering, or drawings). As a portable PC, however, it is an extremely pricey solution. The largest hard drive is 80Gb -- for a laptop that is about the max -- but the rotational speed is 5400 RPM. No doubt this saves power and generates less heat, but the speed hit is significant. Also significant is the cost of RAM upgrades for the unit. Two sticks of 1Gb RAM will set you back another $1700 over the sticker. Getting past the price premiums, though, it's easy to see that the M200 can be a replacement PC with a decent docking station. You'll miss the Firewire connectivity, but the USB 2.0 ports are available and it does comes with an SD card reader in the unit itself. Nice. With the WiFi radio, built-in Ethernet, and built-in modem, there's really no reason why you can't connect on the road. You can opt for the 802.11b or 802.11g radio, but opt for the 11g and get the 54Mps instead. I was a big fan of the Portege 3505 series from Toshiba, and this tablet marks a nice upgrade from that series. Adding WiFi, SD card reader, faster processor, and more RAM options makes this the tablet if you need one... and have the bucks for it. Fred",3
"HP Compaq Tablet PC TC1100 - Pentium M 1 GHz ULV - RAM 512 MB - HDD 40 GB - GF4 420 Go - WLAN : 802.11b - Win XP Tablet PC - 10.4"" TFT 1024 x 768 ( XGA )","The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because one part was broken (which the seller described when I purchased it). Other than that, this is the best computer ever. And when I took it to school with me, others (who had purchased more expensive laptops) were going ga-ga over it. You can write on the outside of the cover when it is closed. You use a stylus pen which pops out of its own little compartment when you gently press down on it. You can detach the keyboard completely if you don't want to use it. There are so many different features that it is just amazing. Sometimes when I take it to class, I will go to the ""One Note"" program and click ""record"" and let it record the teacher speaking. I can even write notes on it. Both the voice and the written notes are typed right into a Word document for me. If you can still find one of these, I would definitely recommend buying it because it is so worth the money. I only paid $220.00 on amazon.com which was a steal deal.",4
"Fujitsu LifeBook T4215 12.1"" Tablet PC","I like the size of the Laptop, have never used a tablet before so I will have to check this feature out. The keyboard is a little rough, but I did buy it used with some miles on the odometer. The system I purchased was 100GB and had windows 7 Professional. As far as weight it is very nice. So far all the programs are running very well with the LifeBook. I recommend using Glary 5 and Wise 365 tools to keep it in good running order, they really help to keep useless files off the system and keep it running smooth. If you have the money go for a newer version, but this one is fine and works well. It was a very expensive Laptop in it's day, running between $1,400 to $2,500 new. Definitely it is ont the quality of a Mac, yet has good features.",3
"Fujitsu LifeBook T4215 12.1"" Tablet PC",Works wonderful I love it,3
"Fujitsu LifeBook T4215 12.1"" Tablet PC","I purchased this ""reconditioned"" T4210 tablet PC for teaching so I could make notes while giving the lecture and then post those notes for the students. Unfortunately, the reconditioners loaded a version of Windows XP that states it is for reconditioned PCs, but it was not the version of Windows XP for Tablet PCs. So there are no tablet functions available. In addition, almost all the original software which came with the Fujitsu T4210 is missing. So I can't be sure (even if I _now_ upgrade to Windows 7), whether I will be able to restore tablet PC functions. So basically, the claim that this was a reconditioned Tablet PC was a fraud. BEWARE. It deserves ZERO stars instead of 1 star, but I couldn't figure out how to give it a zero. BEWARE.",3
"Fujitsu Lifebook T4220 12.1"" Tablet PC","Have three Fujitsu T4220 computers. Good features: able to transition from tablet to laptop, touch screen lets you write/print and then it translates to text, sturdy and spill-resistant keyboard. The not so wonderful: cannot Skype, runs a 32-bit OS.",5
"Fujitsu Lifebook T4220 12.1"" Tablet PC","I received this computer as a holiday gift. These are some of the features I found most amazing about the T4220. - Shock Censor Utility: If you drop your computer, the internal memory and hard drive contract, assuring less memory loss. It automatically detects when it is falling and adjusts accordingly. You can set this to Sensitive, Normal, Mobile, or Custom. - OmniPass: Have to remember lots of passwords to different websites and accounts? Not anymore. With OmniPass and the T4220 Fujitsu notebook, you can set all of your different passwords to either one master password or a fingerprint. I liked this especially because when I go to different websites where I have an account like Hotmail, Amazon, eBay, Facebook, or Myspace, a prompt asks me to scan my fingerprint and then it inputs my password for me. - Windows Vista: The T4220 notebook comes with Windows Vista Basic. I think that this version is fine for just normal notebook purposes, but you can always upgrade the software to fit your needs. - 180 degree Screen: This notebook is a tablet notebook. This means that you can fold the screen down and write on it with the included pen. This notebook can fold either right or left and has easy to understand lights to tell you which way to turn it back to normal. This works especially well with the included Evernote Plus, which translates your hastily scribbled notes into Microsoft Word text. Now you can take notes and have them all on one device. - Built in WiFi: With my old computer, a Dell Latitude D505, I got no bars of WiFi in the corners of my house. However, with this notebook with built in WiFi, I got as many bars in the corner of my house as I did with my old computer sitting next to the router. There is also a slot to put in a WiFi card if you have a special card, but the built in is so good, I don't see why you would need an additional one. - Speakers and Sound: The sound quality of this computer is absolutely amazing. It truly sounds as if you are in a stadium or concert hall. You can also change the speaker settings based on the environment that you are in. They are perfect for DVDs or music. Overall, I give this computer a five out of five based on performance, design, difficulty of use, and already included features. If you are looking for a Microsoft computer, I strongly recommend this one.",5
"Fujitsu Lifebook T4220 12.1"" Tablet PC","I have owned the Fujitsu 4220 for 3 years. I also have a new Dell XT2 (long story, my IT department is on a Dell service contract, enough said). The Fujitsu is awesome, I cannot recommend it more highly. It is fast, bright and strong screen, has all the features (wifi, USB, PCMCIA, firewire) that you would need. If you are looking at Fujitsu tablets and weighing the pros and cons of the 4220 and its progeny, I highly recommend you get a tablet like the 4220 with the swivel screen and built in keyboard. You need the keyboard, and its completely hidden and out of the way when you swivel to tablet mode. With the extra battery in the second bay, you can get up to nine hours which is great, but the Fujitsu batteries like all batteries lose charge capacity over months and years of use. I rarely use the DVD drive and most often have the second battery inserted into the DVD bay. This is a very tough computer, I have had to wrestle it from the hands of a theif and it hit parking lot pavement but is absolutely fine, I was very surprised the screen had no damage at all. I bought 3 stylus thinking I would break or lose one, but the stylus are also very durable (compare to Dell) and the stylus slot right on the front of the screen makes the stylus hard to leave behind. I would change only two things about the Fujitsu: (1) it could be a bit more sleekly designed, its plastic case is tough and flexible which is a great benefit, but the titanium casings on some of the competitor products really look much better, (2) the chips run hot when I have a lot of processes working simultaneously, hotter than my Dell. This causes the fan to run a lot, its variable speed and at highest speed you can hear it (not noisy, you just know its on), and when it is on your lap it can feel a bit hot (great in January but not so during other parts of the year).",5
Fujitsu LifeBook T4220 Tablet PC,This is an excellent computer. It combines the power of laptop with the flexibility of a tablet. I am very impressed with its ability to recognize my hand writing and convert it into typewritten text. I found the stylus pen very responsive and a pleasure to use. Its 2.9 GHZ processor with 2 GB of ram is more than adequate to meet my basic computing needs. This tablet is a little heavier than I would have liked however considering the price and that it’s a fully functioning computer and not just something I can check my e-mail or surf the web with it is well worth the little extra weight. The only downside I found which is typical of my experience with Fujitsu T series tables is that it does drain the battery quickly. So I purchased a backup battery. I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for decent working computer with the ability to function as a tablet.,3
Fujitsu LifeBook T4220 Tablet PC,"No cd drive, Absolutely no software installed but for $200 what did I expect but a screen and keyboard, words, words.",3
Fujitsu LifeBook T4220 Tablet PC,system is great love using it,3
Fujitsu LifeBook T4220 Tablet PC,"I purchased this, along with additional RAM, for around $200. This machine runs faster than a laptop I owned previously that I bought less than a year ago, brand new, for over $400. Windows 7 runs like a dream on this machine, and the stylus-based tablet screen adds for some great versatility. The hard drive it came with was lacking, though. Luckily, I had a larger-capacity harddrive around from an old machine and installation was easy. This is a powerful general-use laptop that's affordable, easily modified, and boasts some nifty features. Definitely one of the best computer buys I've ever made. The only thing keeping this from a five-star rating are the minor upgrades needed to make this machine comparable to current competitors: buying additional RAM and a larger hard drive are recommended.",3
Fujitsu LifeBook T4220 Tablet PC,"It's an older model, but my friends are still jealous. I like its squareness, over the widescreens, and its ease of movement. It's really nice to be able to write on the screen. The only sad thing is that it's missing a webcam, but it really has everything else you might want: SD slot, USB, PC card slot, ethernet, CD drive that can become extra battery storage, tablet mode. Love it! Easy to figure out stuff, mostly quick, not super speedy.",3

Fujitsu LifeBook T4220 Tablet PC,"Good computer which does what I need it to do after I installed Win XP on it. Seller provided Fujitsu LifeBook T4220 Tablet PC original disks and manuals, upon request. Seller was prompt in all correspondence and shipments. The computer arrived with Windows 7 installed (which is a 'neat trick' to do...kudos to the seller), but that wasn't what I needed. The original installation disks come with Windows XP. Good hardware; The computer came installed with Windows 7. I needed Windows XP for my own personal requirements. So I endeavored to tweak the computer's software for personal requirements. I tried to install Windows XP onto this computer, but ONLY AFTER I changed hard disks. (I have limited experience in doing tech work on computers.) I made a mistake and tried to install a 500 GB internal hard disk myself, and ran into numerous operating system glitches (a smaller hard disk would not have run into Old Operating System limitations). When I finally reverted back to the hard disk this computer came with, Windows XP installs wonderfully and the computer operates wonderfully. I have this running perfectly now for about a month. I am VERY SATISFIED. The SELLER did a great job of support. The hours of my day job, the US Postal Service, kept me from working on this computer until recently. The delay in the review and getting the PC working to my needs was a result of personal distractions and not due to the seller. This is a great PC.",3

"HTC Shift X9500 UMPC - 800MHz 1GB 40GB 7"" LCD QuadBand GSM 3G UMTS/HSDPA EDGE Bluetooth Camera WiFi Windows Vista Business Keyboard","Of all the computers I have owned, this was my favorite, and I've owned many computers. I have ridiculous luck when it comes to computer purchases and computer usage. My impulsive buying habits and my need to tweak my computers to the max have caused me to own about 4 of these HTC Shifts at separate times. It's a long story and not the point of this review. The point of this is review is to tell you that the HTC Shift, for its time (2007), was hands down the coolest device on the market. With the onslaught of tablets since then, the HTC Shift has lost its luster, but only in a few respects. If you've come across this product, then you likely know a little about the HTC Shift's uniqueness. You can only seem to find it by searching for an uncommon combination of terms. As you likely already know, the greatest thing about the Shift was that you could simultaneously work in both Windows and Windows Mobile with the click of a button - it was a phone and netbook in one. Out of the box, the Windows Mobile side was locked down though, and you couldn't make calls. But if you were able to figure out how to unlock it and get phone calls to work (via XDA developers website), you could be talking to someone over the cell connection and work on files in Windows at the same time. Because the cellphone capabilities on the Windows Mobile side could be integrated with the Windows side, you could share the data connection, meaning that you never had to turn on Wifi on the Windows side and you'd have a connected Windows netbook anywhere for the price of a single data plan. Further, you could also turn the Shift into a Mobile hotspot using the Windows side's ""internet sharing"" feature. It was 3.5G, which for the time was amazing and still suitable today. If you swapped out the components, the HD for an SSD, 1GB RAM for 2GB, a bigger battery, and Windows Vista for 7, it was truly a very usable computer, so long as you were doing only one taxing thing at a time. It was perfectly capable of handling email checking, lite web browsing, and word processing all at once, but more than that starts to bog down performance. I used to play Starcraft on there with no problems; the touch screen was ideal for gameplay. The keyboard hid away so nicely and the typability was great, of course, my small fingers certainly help there. You also had a built in fingerprint reader for logging in and accessing sites. With a ready VGA compatible monitor on your desk and a dashboard mount in your car, you seriously could work anywhere and stay connected constantly. Here are the drawbacks. The XDA devs never got the cellphone to connect with bluetooth, so you always had to make calls with the built-in mic and speaker. The screen had no sort of palm rejection so writing or drawing was not really feasible. There was no back facing camera. Screen rotation was something of a pain without an accelerometer. The internal parts were kinda weak quality. If you ever opened it up, such as to swap out parts, you would have to be very precise in everything that you did, otherwise you'd end up with one HTC Brick. The internal power button, for instance, was this tiny piece of plastic that snapped off with the slightest pressure from the wrong direction. The Windows Mobile side had a very small ROM chip, 64MB, so you were limited in how much you could use that side. The XDA devs never got the SD card reader to be utilized by the Windows Mobile side, so that didn't help the problem of limited ROM. The HTC Shift was in a league of its own and ahead of its time and we've yet to see anything like it since. I personally think that many of the limitations of the HTC Shift were due to business and communications regulations rather than any design flaw, meaning that the limitations were intended. That's why the mobile side's ROM was limited, that's why the cellphone was locked down, that's why the mobile side couldn't use the SD card, that's why the mobile side couldn't use bluetooth. If regulations were such that a truly all-in-one device could enter the market, we might see more products like the Shift, but until then it's going to be Smartphones, tablets, netbooks, laptops, desktop replacements, desktops, workstations, and so on. Maybe regulators and manufacturers are in cahoots, knowing that if they were to allow the gaps to be bridged between existing products, there'd be less to flood the market with. But with the HTC Shift back in 2007, HTC apparently didn't get the full memo. They're up to speed now. Man, it would be nice if someone ignored the regulations, just once. If you've got an extra $1000 laying around and some hobby time, I'd recommend this device. The base model is cheap and the main accessories (Super Talent 1.8 zif pata 128GB ssd, 2GB 214 pin Microdimm, and Mugen 6600mAh battery) are still available (as of 8 March 2013); they won't be for much longer. However, the likelihood that you'll have this device for more than 3 years is slim. The base unit will likely begin to crumble thereafter - tilt screen mechanism failing, plastic around ports chipping, speaker mesh guards breaking, power button snapping, etc. If I were in the market for a mobile device today (and I didn't have a history of breaking HTC Shift's), I'd very likely give the HTC Shift another go, despite the fact I'd have to spend just over $1000 to get it maxed out, simply because of it's all-in-one design. The HTC Shift certainly had it's flaws, many of which have been fixed by recent mobile devices on the market, but recent devices lack the Shift's all-in-one design. Really, there is no, nor has there ever been, a worth-while product on the market for my tastes, but the HTC Shift came closest so far. Hopefully, HTC is working on an updated version, but I'm not crossing my fingers because of the regulations. Just to clarify the assertion that there is still nothing on the market like the HTC Shift (since 8 Mar '13), I've listed recent offerings that have come close, but explain why they fall short: iPad/Galaxy Tabs/or any tablet (not to be confused with Tablet PCs): - Cannot make cellular calls (not VoIP) - only 1st gen jailbroken iPad can with purchase of an app/most rooted Android devices can (Tab 7.7 (P68000) can out-of-the-box, but shortfalls below still exist) - No keyboard - can be fixed with Clamcase (for iPad) or similar (for others) - Does not run fully functional OS - only work around is running a VNC app, which is tough when away from home network, plus its sluggish when it does work Large Phones (like Galaxy Note): - No keyboard - there are a few specially made keyboards, but their even smaller than the Shift's keyboard. Any bluetooth keyboard could work, but you lose mobility - Does not run fully functional OS - only work around is running a VNC app, which is tough when away from home network, plus its sluggish when it does work Atrix/Padfone/Clambook (combination phone/tablets): - Does not run fully functional OS - only work around is running a VNC app, which is tough when away from home network, plus its sluggish when it does work Windows 8 tablets: - Cannot make cellular calls (not VoIP) - no work around - Drins battery, which takes away from the purpose of a tablet - No mobile OS to sip at the battery and allow longer use of device Addressing an argument: It could be argued that we no longer need a fully functioning OS because so much is being moved to ""the cloud"" - with Office, games, etc. I'll agree with that argument a few years from now, when the online apps are truly ""fully functioning."" As of write now, there is no Adobe CS and Office Live or 365 is no where close to on par to its installable cousin.",4
"HTC Shift X9500 UMPC - 800MHz 1GB 40GB 7"" LCD QuadBand GSM 3G UMTS/HSDPA EDGE Bluetooth Camera WiFi Windows Vista Business Keyboard","I purchased this just as a toy to play around with and I first installed a Windows 7 upgrade that I had lying around here, which worked great. It's very easy to find drivers and everything that you need online for the upgrade. Then, I tried installing Windows 8 Professional, which didn't work out because I could never get the touchscreen working. There are some instructions online and videos on YouTube of Windows 8 working on the X9500, but even when I followed the instructions, I couldn't get it working successfully, so I went back to Windows 7. The worst thing about the HTC Shift X9500 is the battery life. The claim is 2 hours, but I never got more than 1 hr and 15 mins. There are extended batteries available online for around $200 that are supposed to give it 4 hours of battery life, but I felt like it wouldn't be worth the expenses and decided to sell my Shift and purchase one of the new Clover Trail tablets instead.",4

Motion LE1700 Core 2 Duo 1.5GHz 1GB 60GB 12.1-Inch Windows XP Tablet,"I RATE THIS ITEM VERY HIGH. I LIKE THE FACT IT IS ROBUST, WINDOWS BASED AND CAN BASICALLY REPLACE YOUR LAPTOP. THIS IS A GOOD MANUFACTURER THAT MAKES RUGGED UNIT FOR INDUSTRY. ONE WORD OF CAUTION IF YOU BUY A USED MODEL, CHECK IT OVER THOROUGHLY TOP TO BOTTOM AND MAKE SURE IT ALL WORKS WELL. DONT DELAY, YOU ONLY HAVE FOURTEEN DAYS TO NOTIFY THE VENDOR IF YOU FIND A DEFECT. YOU HAVE THIRTY DAYS TO RETURN IT, BUT IT BEGINS TO BE A HASSLE WITH CERTAIN VENDORS. I RECENTLY BOUGHT ANOTHER MOTION COMPUTING TABLET AND HAD A VERY BAD EXPERIENCE WITH THAT VENDOR MESDECART OF COLORADO. THEY ADVERTISED THE UNIT AS BEING IN GOOD WORKING CONDITION AND HAVING BEEN UPDATED WITH WINDOWS 8. UPDATED IT WAS, AND THEN I FOUND OUT THAT WINDOWS 8 HAS NOT ACTUALLY BEEN RELEASED YET SO THERE IS NO SUPPORT, NO DRIVER OR MANUFACTURER UPGRADES OR SUPPORT FOR THAT OPERATING SYSTEM. THE TABLET LOCKED UP CONSTANTLY AND WOULD NOT START AGAIN UNTIL YOU DEPRIVED IT OF ALL POWER INCLUDING REMOVAL OF THE BATTERY FOR A FEW MINUTES. ONCE YOU DID THAT YOU COULD START IT, BUT IF YOU TURNED IT OFF OR IT TRIED TO HIBERNATE FORGET IT, YOU HAD TO REMOVE ALL THE POWER AGAIN. THE BATTERY WAS ALSO IN POOR CONDITION AND THE STYLUS FAILED IN THE 21 DAY OF USE. WHEN I CONTACTED THE VENDOR AND AMAZON I GOT THE RUN AROUND. THEY WANTED TO BLAME THE WINDOWS 8 INSTALL TO WHICH I REPLY, HEY GUYS YOU ADVERTISED IT AS IN GOOD WORKING ORDER WITH WINDOWS 8 AND YOU LIED ABOUT THAT. THEY TOLD ME TO INSTALL WINDOWS 7. OKAY, THEN SEND ME A RESTORE DISK. THEY ORIGINALLY CAME WITH THEM. I GUESS THEY EXPECT ME TO GO OUT AND BUY WINDOWS 7 NOW. THE VENDOR MESARTDECO GAVE FALSE INFORMATION ABOUT HAVING RESOLVED WHAT THEY CALLED A TECHICAL PROBLEM TO AMAZON SO AMAZON HAS FAILED TO STAND BY ME. I AM STILL TRYING TO RESOLVE THIS AND EVEN GAVE THE MERCHANT THE CHANCE TO CREDIT ME FOR A NEW BATTERY, SEND ME A RESTORE DISK AND A STYLUS. OTHERWISE, BY TOMORROW IT IS GOING BACK AND I WILL GET MY REFUND. THE VENDOR WANTS TO CHARGE ME A RESTOCKING FEE EVEN THOUGH THEY WILL BE GETTING IT BACK WITHIN THE 30 DAY RETURN PERIOD. LIKE I SAID, I LIKE THESE MOTION COMPUTING PRODUCTS. THEY ARE RUGGED AND WORTH THE USED PRICE IF YOU GET AN HONEST VENDOR WHO WILL STAND BEHIND THE SALE. IN REGARD TO THIS MODEL, I LIKE IT BETTER THAN THE OTHER ONE I AM RETURNING BECAUSE IT HAS A BIGGER SCREEN, MORE PORTS AND UPGRADE ABILITY LIKE A LAPTOP. IT CAN DO ALOT AND EVEN SOME THINGS THAT LAPTOPS USUALLY DONT PROVIDE. THIS ONE HAS A FINGERPRINT SECURITY SYSTEM. NOW THE FIRST ONE I ORDERED CAME WITH A BAD POWER SUPPLY AND I JUST GOT IT SO THIS TIME, I CONTACTED THE VENDOR AND AMAZON RIGHT AWAY TO RETURN IT NO DELAYS NO FOOLING AROUND ON THESE USED PRODUCTS. IF YOU FIND A PROBLEM THEN MY ADVISE IS SEND IT BACK RIGHT AWAY. THAT IS WHAT I AM DOING. BUT I LIKE THIS MODEL SO WELL THAT I DID GO AHEAD AND ORDER ANOTHER ONE FROM A DIFFERENT VENDOR. HOPEFULLY THIRD TIME IS A CHARM. THEY EVEN HAD A BETTER PRICE WHEN I ORDERED THE ONE TO REPLACE THIS ONE. IT IS TOO SOON TO SEE IF THE VENDOR WHERE I GOT THIS LE1700 WILL HONOR THE GUARANTEES WITHOUT A HASSLE BUT I HOPE SO. I AM ON IT HAVING BEEN BURNT BY MESDECART. AMAZON USUALLY HANDLES THOSE MATTERS WELL, BUT THIS TIME THEY ARE FALLING SHORT AND FALLING FOR THE LIE OF MESDECART. I BOUGHT THAT UNIT BASED ON THE DESCRIPTION THAT IT WAS IN GOOD WORKING ORDER AND THOUGHT THAT WAS PLUS THEY HAD WINDOWS 8 ON IT. BOY WAS I WRONG. AND NOW THAT IT IS NOT IN GOOD WORKING CONDITION, EVEN IF WINDOWS 8 IS PART OF THE REASON, THE BATTERY IS BAD AND SO IS THE STYLUS. THE BATTERY IS AN ISSUE BECAUSE THEY COST 186 DOLLARS, THEY DO NOT HAVE A GENERIC AND THE SAME WITH THE STYLUS. THEY MAKE THEM GOOD, BUT THEY ARE EXPENSIVE TO REPLACE. BOTTOM LINE DO BUY THIS TABLET, YOU WILL PROBABLY LIKE IT IF YOU DONT MIND THAT IT IS A BID HEAFTY, BUT THE USED PRICE IS RIGHT. I LIKE A TALBET THAT WILL RUN WINDOWS RATHER THAN ANDROID AND LIKE A STANDARD PC YOU CAN UPGRADE THE MEMORY INSTALL BIGGER HARD DRIVES, PCMCIA CARDS, IT HAS DIGITAL VIDEO AND A GREAT BRIGHT MONITOR. THE ANDROID TABLETS ARE NICE, BUT TO DO WHAT THIS DOES, YOU WOULD BE PAYING ABOUT A THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR A MODEL THAT CAN COMPETE USING WINDOWS 7 AS ITS OPERATING SYSTEM. THANKS FOR READING THIS.",4
Motion LE1700 Core 2 Duo 1.5GHz 1GB 60GB 12.1-Inch Windows XP Tablet,"Device came in the mail in about a week. It was in great shape. The battery only lasts about 30 minutes but batteries are consumable and it was probably the original battery that was sold with the device back in 2008. I did not realize there are 4 orignal options for the screen. There is a standard XGA (1024 x 768), a View Anywhere version of the XGA which improves reading of the screen in direct sunlight, an SXGA screen (1400 x 1050) and an Ultraview Anywhere of the SXGA that also allows better reading in direct sunlight. I have read that the standard SXGA is better than the XGA View Anywhere as the higher resolution really makes the screen POP! My LE1700 came with the standard SXGA screen and it really is FABULOUS! I bought it for the sole purpose to put Windows 8 Pro on it. The Windows 8 tablets on the market today are going for more than $600.00 and they usually come with Windows 8 RT. You cannot run standard Windows apps on RT. Windows 8 Pro installed near perfectly. All of the drivers were installed automatically. The only issues I had were 1) Even though the bluetooth drivers seemed to be installed, I could not bring up the bluetooth menu in Windows 8 to pair to anything. I am using an IOGEAR bluetooth dongle for my bluetooth needs. 2) Pen flicks works on it but performs exceptionally bad. Disable pen flicks. Firefox has a Grab and Drag plugin that does the same as pen flicks that does work very well. But, only when using Firefox. I would also recommend upgrading the RAM to at least 3GB. Performance is not an issue with Windows 8 and the device is very responsive and works very well. Even with Youtube, Netflix and Hulu. Just be aware that this thing weighs a little over 3 lbs. And it has a 12.1 inch screen which is rather large by today's tablet standards where the largest tablets come in at 10.1 inch size. But, unlike the tablets you can but today, this tablet runs just about any application that runs on Windows 7 and a lot that run on Windows XP. Buy it! Put Windows 8 Pro on it! Love it! Use it! There is a keyboard dock for it, as well, which can be had for typically under $30.00. Its a nice addition. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because of the pen flicks issues and also because the bottom of the device gets pretty HOT. All of the reviews of the device say this and they blame it on the duo core processor. Its not that awful, but it will get rather warm using it for an extended period of time.",4
"Apple iPad 2 MC770LL/A Tablet (32GB, Wifi, Black) 2nd Generation","For anyone out there who is considering whether or not to make the leap and purchase the iPad 2, this review is for you. If you're still debating between the iPad 1 and the iPad 2 check out my review of the first generation iPad right here on Amazon to see a discussion of its strengths and weaknesses with a number of people commenting (both positively and negatively) over the past 11 months. Let me begin by saying this upfront, I don't work for Apple, I don't own Apple Stock, and whether you buy an iPad, Xoom, a laptop or a pad of paper and pencil I don't get anything for writing this. I'm not an Apple ""fanboy"" although I can give credit where credit is due and lately Apple has deserved a lot of credit for some of their products. Physical Characteristics The iPad 2 is absurdly thin. More importantly than it's thinness is its tapered edge which feels more natural in your hand. One of the biggest complaints about the original iPad was it really wasn't tremendously comfortable to hold for long periods at a time. For a tablet device designed to be held, that's a pretty big deal. Apple really has done an amazing job of cramming everything into an even smaller space than before and the difference is really noticeable when you're holding the device. In addition to the tapered edge, Apple managed to reduce the overall weight of the iPad 2. That might not seem like a huge deal to most, especially when you consider the weight difference isn't tremendous when you're already under 2 pounds, but I spend a good part of my day holding the iPad in my hands and the weight difference is surprising by the end of the day. The first generation isn't heavy by any means, but the iPad 2 outshines it. New and ""Improved"" Apple doubled the RAM in the iPad 2 from 256MB to 512MB. What does that mean? For most casual users, probably not a whole lot. There is a performance bump that everyone will see the effects of in things like loading times for webpages that are open in the background, but 256MB was sufficient for most daily use and games. If you're planning to use your device for some of the more graphically intense games the iPad 2 does offer a better method of graphics processing that'll help deliver faster images with fewer jerky movements. If you're just playing Angry birds and reading e-mail you're not going to know the difference. The screen is the same for all real purposes. It is technically a ""new"" part in that it isn't identical to the old, it's a bit thinner and more efficient, but it's the same resolution. The Glass is thinner though, and this amounts to a fair bit of the weight loss from one generation to the next. In playing with the device it seems surprising but despite feeling lighter it actually feels more sturdy in your hands. I still wouldn't suggest dropping it, but if it were to fall the iPad 2 certainly feels like it might stand a better chance to survive. Try not to drop it though. The addition of 2 cameras was expected. Some were a bit surprised to see the first generation released without the cameras. Whether it was for a price point consideration, or a means to get people to upgrade, Apple held off until iPad 2. The cameras do a reasonable job, but they're not going to replace a dedicated digital camera, or really even the camera on your phone for most still images. The cameras do a substantially better job with video, and FaceTime is probably one of the best reasons to get the iPad 2 over the original iPad. For those who might not be familiar, FaceTime is Apple's face to face conferencing system, kind of like Skype, or if you'd rather, kind of like the Jetson's TV/Phone. With the push of a button you can be having a face to face chat with a loved one just about anywhere in the world (provided they're on a wireless network at the time). FaceTime doesn't work over 3G natively (it can be used over a wifi connection created by a 3G device however) so you're not going to be able to use it in your car anytime soon. This is probably a good thing though. It is incredibly easy to use and if you know other people with an iPad 2, iPhone 4, or Mac it's a lot of fun. Smart Covers aren't really ""smart"" but they're really very useful. Not only do they provide a stylistic enhancement of the device, but they serve a practical and functional purpose of doubling as a screen protector and stand in 2 configurations. You can find them in a variety of colors and from third market suppliers, and it's a safe bet that more will be out soon to capitalize on the magnetic sensors in the iPad 2. It's unfortunate that this same feature can't somehow be retrofitted to the iPad 1, I wouldn't have thought a case would be a compelling reason to consider a product over it's competitor, but these covers are really so useful it's hard to understand why they've not been there since the beginning. Multitasking Support One of the biggest knocks against the iPad when first released was the lack of native multi-tasking support. Jailbreakers added the feature quickly and Apple soon realized it would be a requirement for any future device's success and released an OS update that included the feature. The iPad 2 capitalizes on that progress and takes it a step further with the increased RAM enabling more open applications to be suspended at once, and the time to open or close an application has improved as well. That said, even the first generation managed to open and close apps faster than most people would be used to on their computers, so while this is an improvement it's more akin to showing off. Apps One thing that Apple has clearly the advantage in for the moment is app availability. The App store has close to 70,000 iPad specific Apps, all of which will work on the iPad 2. The new cameras will undoubtedly see this list expand rapidly, as will the inclusion of a gyroscope for gaming and motion based uses. There are also a substantial number of professional applications ranging from document creation to photo editing and vector drawing. Chances are if you can dream it, there's an App for that (and if not you might want to get started on one to fill in the gap). The Android market is making a strong showing, and ultimately it'll likely be a strong competitor, for now it still has a ways to go, but any potential buyer should consider the strength of the application market before buying a tablet. Pros: Weight. Seriously. The minimal weight of this thing is by far the most impressive feature about it in my opinion. It seems to defy physics and logic that so much could be in such a small space working that hard for that long. Battery Life. From full to dead my iPad 2 went just over 11 hours with the movie Robin Hood showing twice during that time, the screen at half brightness, wifi turned on, an Angry Birds marathon and a good portion of a book in ibook. That's better than a work day and that's constantly on. Books. This is definitely a Pro, but reading itself could go either way. The great benefit to the iPad is having access to Google Books, ibook, Nook, and Kindle. This allows for some comparison shopping and price competition (although for the most part they're all usually about the same). Reading in the evenings in bed is great as the back light means you don't have to worry about keeping others awake, but the glass screen causes some glare trouble when trying to read outside or near a sunny window. If you're an avid outdoor reader the Kindle might still be your best bet. Cons: Still no dedicated USB support. While there is a camera add-on that allows for certain USB devices to be used there is no option for mass storage. Some of the Android Tablets allow for this and if you find yourself wanting to use your tablet as a standalone storage device this might be something to consider. The device can read from certain flash drives though, but is largely limited to photo and video files. Jailbreaks offer solutions to this, but those come with their own issues as well. Still no dedicated SD card slot. This is troublesome on two fronts. First, if you want to import pictures from your camera you have to have an adapter which is just one more thing to carry around. Second, the lack of expansion means you're limited to what you purchase in terms of storage. I purchased a 32GB iPad last time and never filled it up completely, so for me capacity wasn't an issue. If you want to be able to have your entire movie collection with you though... you may want to consider whether the iPad 2 can meet your space requirements. HDMI output. Really this is a Pro and a Con. The iPad does allow for HD output over HDMI but again it requires an adapter. All of these adapters are additional purchases for features that some tablets offer built in. This can be a pain, but then again if you're not likely to ever use HDMI Output then you're not paying for something you won't use. No Flash Support. This is becoming less and less of an issue as the internet and web developers are moving away from Flash for many websites, but there are a lot still out there relying on Adobe's Flash to run properly (including a lot of web based games). Before you pick a tablet consider what kind of websites you frequent and try and determine if they are Flash driven or not. If they are you may really want to consider something from the Android offerings as it is expected that they'll have at least some Flash support. If you're in the market for a tablet device the iPad 2 should definitely be on your short list. If you're uncertain it is always best to go and play with these things hands on first if you can. Best Buy is a good place for that, so are Verizon Stores since they have the Xoom and 3G iPad. Don't get pulled into the hype and mania that comes with an Apple release. They're exciting and new, and they're impressive enough to warrant some excitement, but it will die down and there will be other products that prove a strong competitor to the iPad 2. If you're looking for right now though, this is probably your best bet. I gave the device 4 stars, as I did the iPad 1. I did this in contemplation of the features offered by competitors that are absent from the iPad, most notably the requirement for adapters for USB/SD/HDMI. While these features are there, they aren't as convenient as in other tablets. With that in mind I firmly believe that the iPad more than makes up for this in usability, reliability, and design and in those areas far exceeds its current competitors.",3

"Apple iPad 2 MC770LL/A Tablet (32GB, Wifi, Black) 2nd Generation","My 1st issue is that the plug & charger were a joke. The Lightning charging cord wouldn't insert in either direction & on my 3rd try it went 1/2 in & broke as I pulled it out. I went to Apple Store & spent $19.95 for a cord. Then I tried to plug the board into the plug it came with & it didn't work at all. Fortunately I was able to use the new cord w my iPhone plug. SO - one of the main reasons I decided to buy this refurbished ipad2 from this vendor was that I could save all the expense of buying chargers - Nope! BTW, the cord & converter were both brand new, cheap knock off brands. As far as the refurbished iPad2 - it's ok I guess. It looks new, clean screen & it is exactly as described - it's good for email, internet search, pintrest, YouTube - I'm not a gamer so not sure about that. Takes a long time to charge (several hours) & gets very slow if I have too many apps - so I deleted FB app & a few others. I wish I had bought something newer w hi-resolution, but this is ok - except the charger thing wasn't cool. Don't let ur buying decision be based on that - just plan to go buy them at Apple Store or use ur iPhone charger if it will fit.",3

When plugged in the iPads went nuts, jumping from app to app and almost screwing them up.

I filed it down some as it was catching the skin, very sharp. It's an older Ipad so it's not as responsive and quick as the new ones. But still a great product. For the price I'm very pleased! Reduction in stars due to the damage on the case being left as is. It's right there by the screen almost touching it already..

Fujitsu LifeBook U820 Mini-Notebook,"I love this little gem, but it's certainly not for everyone. First, let's talk about the basics. This is an ultra-mobile PC (UMPC) and not a netbook. They're different, though often confused because they are both smaller than regular laptops. The main difference with a UMPC is that it's a touch-screen device, so this is not only a tiny laptop, it's a tiny tablet PC. And that's what you should be thinking about first if you are considering this. If you just want to surf the Net on a small little notebook while sitting on the couch, then get a netbook. Their screens are larger, their keyboards are larger and they're very well-suited to that task. If, however, you are looking for something to use as a tiny, and less expensive, tablet PC -- taking handwritten notes, freeform drawing, interacting with your screen with a stylus, etc. -- then this is a great option. For me, it's the perfect size and form factor for what I wanted out of it... a travel laptop that takes up almost no space, and a notetaker to carry to meetings in place of a paper notepad or a PDA. You can read the specs for yourself, so let me talk about the things I wondered before getting it as that's where I think these reviews are really helpful. Size. It's smaller than you think from looking at the pictures. The distance from the heel of my palm to the ends of my fingers is longer than this in both dimensions. That's good from a portability standpoint, but does have implications for the screen. Screen. With a resolution of 1280x800 on a 5.6"" screen, it makes a gorgeous, sharp and crisp image, but the letters in Windows are very small. I had to increase my system fonts to a custom size of 136dpi to keep from having to squint too hard. I'm 51 and my close vision isn't what it used to be. With those settings, the dialogs are small, but fine, though there are some programs whose dialogs end up overwriting some of the letters. Fujitsu built-in a zoom utility, activated by one of the buttons, that will let you see the screen if something is just too small. It works, but certainly isn't the same as just seeing something well in the first place. Still, it's all workable. In a perfect world, I would take this exact same computer with a 7-8"" screen, but such systems cost over twice as much and it's not worth the difference to me. Speed. You have to wonder with a 1.6 GHz CPU and 1GB of RAM under Vista how fast this thing will be. Well, the answer is not fast, but fast enough. Remember, this isn't your main computer and it's not for big-time number crunching or game playing. It's a companion for travel and notetaking, etc. It did tend originally to spend way too much time grinding away at the HDD. That's Vista. So I went to some UMPC enthusiast sites and found lists of things to turn off to speed it up (indexing, Windows Defender, etc.). That has helped a lot and it's really quite responsive now... not as fast as my desktop or large laptop, but perfectly fine for what I ask of it. I will probably put Windows 7 on here as soon as it's released as the word is that it's much faster than Vista. Some people on forums have gone back to XP, but then you have driver issues, some features don't work and you get a lesser tablet experience. Battery life. It's everything they claim. I haven't actually run tests, per se, but I am easily getting 5 hours while set on high performance (poorest battery life) mode. In low power mode (a built-in setting that turns off wireless radios, CF/SD slots, etc.), it was right on track to last 8 hours, though I haven't ever actually asked that of it. This is a huge difference versus the netbooks out there. They're all still getting laptop-like 2-3 hour battery runs. It comes with a 4-cell battery; that's what's sticking out the back in the images. You can also order a 2-cell if you want the battery flush, but I actually find that the battery is the best 'handle' for this little computer. It's the easiest and most secure part to pick it up by, so I don't think I'd want the small battery. Connectivity. This is a real strong-point. It came with 802.11b/g/n wi-fi and bluetooth 2.0. You can order a version with an AT&T wireless cell phone card built-in, but I didn't. AT&T doesn't do well in my area, and I wouldn't want another cell phone account anyway, plus it's dead easy to use my Windows Mobile 3G smartphone as a modem for this when I'm not in wi-fi range. About two clicks on each device and it's online. Build quality is excellent. For all that it's a small little thing, it has a very solid feel. It's well fitted and finished with a shiny piano-black top. Of course, the top is a bit of a fingerprint magnet, but it's still quite nice when it's clean. The tablet screen turns around a folds flat, so there's a tiny bit of play in the hinge, but nothing that you wouldn't expect given the function. You do want to be gentle as you turn it back and forth between the tablet and laptop modes, but that's just common sense for a screen that's attached by a single point. Extras. Fujitsu has gone out of their way to add a wide variety of useful extras, but have left some opportunities behind. It has both an SD and CF slot. That's a plus, but a bit disappointing in the implementation. The SD slot is regular SD, not SDHC so you're limited to 2GB regular SD cards. That's a real letdown given how little extra it would have cost to bring that up-to-date. I've read some people question having the CF slot at all, but for those of us who travel with DSLR cameras, that's a very useful thing. It's a bit slow, though. There is only one USB port and it's really a pain sometimes not to have a second. However, if you make good use of the Bluetooth, you can find non-USB substitutes for things like mouses, leaving the USB port free for flash drives. (I got a nice MS Bluetooth Notebook Mouse from Amazon and it works like a charm.) The VGA and wired Ethernet both come out of a proprietary port on the front with a dongle sort of adaptor. I could live with the adaptor since those are not common things to need, but it's a terribly awkward place to put the port. The built-in stylus for the touchscreen is terrible. Since taking notes is a major part of what I bought this for, I bought a separate regular-sized stylus pen to use in meetings. The built-in one is okay for light stuff if you're out and around, but plan to get a decent stylus. Using it. Fujitsu envisions you holding this in both hands, using your thumbs both to use the pointing stick / mouse buttons and to type. The pointing stick and left/right mouse buttons work very nicely, but the thumb typing idea simply doesn't work. Your thumbs just don't bend that way. You'll need to either set it on a table or your lap to use the keyboard (though I've done a bit of one-finger while holding it with the other hand) or use it in tablet mode. I'm finding tablet mode to be more and more useful as I get used to it. The handwriting regonition is excellent and it's integration with One Note is superb. Another little plus in Vista that has come in handy for this is the built-in speech recognition. I don't use it all the time, but I've started using it to dictate emails when in tablet mode. It also comes with a fingerprint reader for logging on. The fingerprint reader will also keep track of web page logins, but I found that didn't work as well as I'd like so I only use the login feature. They thoughtfully built-in dedicated scroll keys and I use those all the time for scrolling through emails, web pages, eBooks, etc. The fingerprint reader will also scroll pages, but I like the dedicated keys better. Improvements from the U810. I had found the U810 at a fantastic price of just under $600. (As I write this, it is over $800 in the Amazon Marketplace.) I almost got it, but then went ahead and paid the extra for the U820 and I'm glad I did. If you read of some those U810 reviews, you'll find people commenting on deficiencies in the keyboard. Well, it's still small (and so I do four-finger typing and still hit some wrong keys), but it has all the keys you'd want now... two shift keys, a separate tab key, arrow keys, etc. that the U810 lacked. The RAM is the same, but the processor is faster and supports hyperthreading. The U820 also adds a built-in GPS with Garmin's MobilePC maps for the US. It works quite well, though it's not as comfortable in your car to use a small laptop or tablet as to use a dedicated GPS unit. Where do you set it that you can see it easily? Still, if you don't have a dedicated GPS, this definitely does the job, but what it will probably do is end up convincing you that you want a dedicated GPS. Given the difference in prices between the U810 and U820 as I write this (a bit over $100), moving up to the U820 is a no-brainer. Since the U810 is discontinued, it's price will fall and you'll have to decide for yourself when the difference is worth it. For me, the U820 was the way to go. The money will be gone and forgotten soon, but the irritating quirks in the U810 keyboard will be with your for the life of the computer. Overall impression. Listen, I totally understand that the need for somethig like this is a niche and that most people would probably be better off with a netbook with twice the screen at half the price. But once you understand what this is for, and if you need that, then it's one sweet little computer. I've used PDAs for many years and while they have been really useful, there have always been times that I had to agnoize over whether to pack the laptop for a trip (so I could run some Windows programs) or try to get by with just the PDA. I've travelled both ways and neither is completely satisfactory. This solves that problem as I have the small size of a PDA (okay, a bit bigger) with a full Windows computer. I'm not saying that I would want to spend hours developing spreadsheet models on this little screen, but it's great to travel with something this small, while still carrying all my work files and programs with me in a useable form. Also, this ultra-high-res screen makes a fantastic eBook reader while you're passing away time in airports. In my new computing life, I always have my smartphone, I have my latop for desktop use and for portable use where I need a lot of speed or power, and I have this as an in-between solution as a travel companion and meeting notetaker. I use Windows Live Mesh to keep them all synchronized so any work I do on the U820 is automatically moved onto my laptop and vice versa (and to my smart phone for certain things). There are some things I would change about the U20 if I were designing its successor, but overall it has become an extremely useful part of my computing world.",3
Fujitsu LifeBook U820 Mini-Notebook,"Bought this machine a few years ago, it has excellent screen, super long battery life and runs quiet. I have upgraded it to an SSD and this baby is fast, much better than other micro PCs. The keyboard IS small, screen IS small, but if you are looking for a spare/backup laptop to travel around, you can't beat its combination of performance, battery life and ports. Comes with VGA, USB and SD card (full size). I have the extended battery and it can routinely provide more than 8 hours battery life. Flip it and make it a tablet and you have your modern windows 8.1 tablet! Even Win 8 apps runs fine. Five stars for aging gracefully!",3
Fujitsu LifeBook U820 Mini-Notebook,"I'm a college student who bought this because my main laptop is too heavy to carry to school and back. Pros: -Tiny. It feels almost weightless to carry, which is wonderful if you're toting lots of books around. -Touch screen is great for writing and note taking. I can write almost completely normally, and comfortably, for extended periods of time using a stylus. I do my homework on it and take written notes, rather than typed, during class. -Long battery life. Right now, with two batteries and a 91% charge with a balanced mode, I am told I will get 10 hrs and 43 minutes. I've never tested it, but the battery life is very good. -Voice activation: it's just that cool to be able to tell your computer to open a file instead of actually clicking. Takes some getting used to, thought. -Has video and audio recording. Excellent for recording meetings, class lectures, etc. -I like the interface. There are numerous ways to interact with the computer. Like I mentioned earlier, it has voice recognition software, you can write on it with a stylus, even right click with a stylus. There are scroll down buttons, zoom buttons, right and left mouse click buttons as well as the mouse itself (which you can left click with). It comes with an adapter for ethernet and LAN connection to a projector. There's also button to rotate the orientation of the screen if you want to write in portrait or landscape mode. -Runs quiet: Once I optimized it (see below) and when the fans aren't running, the computer is completely silent, which I like a lot. Cons: -Small screen: this is both a good thing and a bad thing. I picked this computer because it was smaller than other Fujitsus I had tried. The larger screens meant your hand rested on the screen and made writing difficult to impossible. With a small screen my fingers are long enough to write across it without touching the screen. I've also found that resting my hand on a book helps. But I did have to adjust some of the settings to make things bigger. I am 22 with 20-20 eyesight and I had to hunch over, zoom in, or crank up the font size on my web browser. 5.6 inches is definitely pushing the limits of human comfort. -Small keyboard: I can type on it. But I have relatively small hands. Even with smaller hands, the keyboard is tricky because things have been moved around for space's sake. I've had it for about ten days now and only now am I able to get up some speed when typing--like now for instance. It's doable, but if you have big hands or need to type a lot a larger model might be a better fit. -Stylus: the one that comes with the computer is too small to write with. I bought some styluses from Frys and they work great. I definitely recommend people get their own, thought, unless you don't mind your hand cramping like crazy. -Optimizing Vista: Vista is not the best operating system for this little computer and it took me several days to get the laptop running at an efficient speed. It will never run as fast as my $3000 Dell laptop, but it runs perfectly fine for note taking, email checking, homework writing, and net surfing. Don't expect to be able to play a lot of hardcore games. Recommendations: -Be really gentle with it, especially the swivel screen. It's tiny and can't withstand a lot of force. -I was happy I got the two batteries, they've served me well. -Read the users manual and the start up manual. I spent the first few days frustrated because I didn't read it, thinking I was above instruction manual. Some of the features were very new to me (like voice activation) and I needed the tutorials for that. In summary: I recommended it to all my college friends who need small computers to take notes on that are highly portable and touch screen. This computer was one of the few I found that really combined everything I wanted--touch screen, small, long battery life, records audio/visual. It's perfect for certain subgroups of computer owners like students. In retrospect, I think a 7inch screen would've been perfect, but c'est la vie. I love it and I take it with me everywhere. The only reason I gave it four stars was because of Vista, but once I switch the operating system to Linex or Windows 7 I think it'll be a definite 5.",3
Fujitsu LifeBook U820 Mini-Notebook,I did a fairly through review of this product back in February of 2010 and wanted to share those videos with everyone! https://www.youtube.com/embed/E79dq5r39nM https://www.youtube.com/embed/88fXhOpYAuE https://www.youtube.com/embed/AIq_GqKUss8 https://www.youtube.com/embed/OntX9YnfDOU,3
Fujitsu LifeBook U820 Mini-Notebook,"After 21 months my Fujitsu U820's hard drive quit. I replaced it after Fujitsu Tech Support told me the error message I got meant the hard drive was no good. I then attempted to restore it's Windows 7 Operating System with the restore discs I purchased from Fujitsu. The Vista Restore disc worked, but when I went to use the Windows 7 disc, it told me that it was not for the U820. After reapeatedly calling Fujitsu support and them trying to send me to third party companies, they admitted that they had no resore discs for Windows 7 (even though they include one in the set I bought) and they wouldn't help me any further. Be wary of buying this unit, it's hard drive might give out early and all you get from Fujitsu is a runaround trying to restore the machine.",3
Fujitsu LifeBook T5010 Tablet PC Centrino 2 vPro - Intel Core 2 Duo P8600 2.40 GHz - 13.30,"It's perfect for digital art if you don't expect to do a massive project. I have installed Sketchbook Pro and Mischief, both work fine and have no trouble loading images. The stylus doesn't need batteries and the screen is pressure sensitive; perfect for drawing. You can also play games on this. I have tried League of Legends on minimum settings and it plays at 45 fps, even after the Summoner's Rift visual update. Hearthstone is almost lag free on medium settings, it's faster than one of my newer HP laptops sold at Walmart. The PC itself is lightweight and the monitor can rotate 360 degrees. Technically you can put it in ""tent mode"" even though that function isn't advertised, but you have to change the screen settings to portrait upside down or landscape upside down. Unfortunately the screen resolution is fairly low for my standards and the fan gets hot. But for the most part this machine does what I want it to and that's amazing considering that this thing was designed years ago. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to paint on the go (don't forget your battery charger) since it's cheaper than other products that cost twice as much for similar capabilities. Have fun!",4
Fujitsu LifeBook T5010 Tablet PC Centrino 2 vPro - Intel Core 2 Duo P8600 2.40 GHz - 13.30,"This computer arrived on time, but it was not as pictured. There was no CD/DVD drive. The computer was not dual touch, it was only touch by the pen that came with it. It had Windows Vista on it, which I have never liked that OS. I requested to return it for refund, and the seller answered very quickly, offering to send me an external DVD drive, or to change it out for another computer of better quality, or I could just return it for a refund. The seller answered all of my messages to him within minutes of contacting them. I did return the computer, as I did not like it and could not work with it. As a seller, I highly trust this seller and feel they did an awesome job in doing what they could to make sure it was a positive experience for me.

Fujitsu LifeBook T5010 Tablet PC Centrino 2 vPro - Intel Core 2 Duo P8600 2.40 GHz - 13.30,"I have had a pair of Fujitsu Lifebook t5010's for about a year now and I really have no idea what the other reviewers are talking about. I have one at home and one in my office that I have sync'ed data wise for ease of use. These two laptops are easily the most dependable computers I have ever owned (starting back in the Apple IIe days). The motion/shock sensor has saved my data on more than a couple of occasions when I fell asleep holding the computer in my lap and had it tumble to the floor. The screen is bright and easy to read in all kinds of lighting conditions including outdoors (I have another laptop that claims you can read the screen outdoors but with the Fujitsu YOU CAN). I have never had any problems what so ever with the pen and pen callibration took less than five minutes and I have NEVER had to re-set or re-callibrate the pen. Tha battery charges quickly and lasts on average over three and a half hours per charge if I am not watching movies or using the dvd drive much which cuts into battery time. I routinely use this with a 31"" external monitor with no problems what so ever. The graphics card is not really a gaming card so don't expect blazing fast frame rates but it is faster than my Asus VX-2. In tablet mode you can have it in portrait or landscape and you can set it so that it either follows how you a re holding it or maintains the setting you have chosen. I have Windows XP Tablet Edition as the operating system on one my t5010's and Windows 7 on the other. No problems with either oS. It is a fast powerfull computer and after a year I still have not found anything I did not like about the computer. You can find these laptop/tablets anywhere from $450 (refurbished) up to about $1149 on line. Enjoy DRBurroughs",4
HP TouchSmart tx2z Customizable Notebook PC,Ok for a refurbished laptop,1
HP TouchSmart tx2z Customizable Notebook PC,Dont trust this seller! This laptop came totally ruined and it didnt even turn on. i wasted money trusting this lier. he promised alot of bull shit and this laptop wouldnt even turn on. when i contacted him all he said is that i could return it and i was not willing to pay to return it again because it was his damn fault. i am usually a happy customer but his service is beyond and worse then crap. i wasted two days straight to fix it and above all i got shocked in the process and had to waste another $85 of equip that i already had from my past work and laptops i saved. and turns out even had to replace that hard drive and ram. you suck dont sell if you cant keep your word to it,1
HP TouchSmart tx2z Customizable Notebook PC,"In the beginning, I was so excited about this computer! I bought it in late 2009 straight from HP and was overly excited about the, seemingly, infinite things I could do with this computer. I was excited about the technology--even before the the Windows 7 upgrade, it was cool. From the start, I had minor problems--the computer would shut off on it's own in a very odd way. Battery wouldn't be dead or anything, but it was frequent. The computer's fan was always on and LOUD. I always took care to ensure that it wasn't in a position to run hot, but the fan just kept on running. I called in to HP, they sent me through the Bios screen to, as I understand it, keep the fan running so that computer wouldn't overheat. Didn't help much at all. Then, not even a year after having the computer, a pink line appeared in the middle of my screen. I called to ask HP about it, they said there was nothing they could do about it--it was a problem with the screen. OK, big deal to me(because I, like everyone else here paid a whole hell of a lot of money for this machine--much more than the $525 it's currently selling for), but I let it slide. The battery needed to be replaced so quickly--I didn't even have the cheapest battery--it only lasted a little over a year. It showed signs of decline before that (a computer I used for school purposes and kept on power saving settings MOST of the time). I bought a new battery (I won't even get into the trouble I had with HP's customer service regarding that--that's a whole other issue), then a few months later, I'm experiencing my computer shutting off and making this odd sound (kind of like how cartoons sound when they run/zoom away--think road runner) while I would be in the middle of something. That went on for months before I was completely locked out of my computer. I only had the option to remove my files onto an external hard drive (which I also bought from HP--Simple Save), then restore the computer to factory settings (which took away the Window 7 upgrade). Well, I had it up and running for a little bit, just to have it go out one day after I closed it (put it to sleep) to run out somewhere for a moment. Suddenly, I remembered I had to do something else. I opened the computer to see flashing lights (I think the CAPS and maybe two other lights). I tried pressing buttons--no response. I tried turning it off (it went off), then turned it back on--same thing, just flashing lights. So finally, I decided to do an internet search by entering my computer's symptoms, only to come across a huge number of reviews/complaints of people with the EXACT SAME ISSUE. Not only that, they had done things the exact same way (computer went to sleep and they couldn't wake it back up). I read review after review--complaint after complaint. The most disappointing thing was that everyone had the same issue--HP didn't care. They would not fix it or even acknowledge it as an issue with these computers. Most people were like me and out of warranty. Well, HP wasn't going to help, so I went to good old, trusty Youtube to find a solution. Amazingly, there were several videos of people either replacing motherboards in the computer, or taking the computer a part and adding silver compound and a penny to rectify the problems, sometimes. Unfortunately, after CAREFULLY/METICULOUSLY taking my computer apart and trying the fix, my computer was not fixed. Although I was able to move the majority of my files on to my external hard drive, previously--I had since bought some songs on itunes in between updating my back up and when it died on me. I guess the only way I'll see those files again is if I purchase an enclosure for my internal hard drive or something else to get my files off. How disappointing is that?! The computer that keeps on costing! As someone who believed in HP products and had an HP desktop in high school and a lap top in college that lasted me quite a while, I am very disappointed in my experience with this computer and with HP's customer service when it came to resolving this issue. I'm also disappointed that HP sees this computer is defective, yet they've made ZERO strides to resolve this issue. Needless to say--after years of me and my family purchasing HP and Compaq products, we'll never lay a hand on another. DO NOT BUY THIS COMPUTER! It'll be the worst mistake you've ever made! It currently serves as the most expensive paperweight I've ever seen.",1
HP TouchSmart tx2z Customizable Notebook PC,"Pros: - Touchscreen - Screen swivel (cool for showing someone across from you what's on the screen) Cons: - Runs hot. Reviews have said before and I'll second it - I've suspected for a while that these laptops run way hotter than should be allowed. - Horrible repair service - I bought the three year warranty and it's spent almost an entire year in the shop - over 4 repair trips. Sometimes the repair place would check off that they replaced something they didn't touch - which I found out after marking some parts with permanent marker. The marks were still there when returned. Also you can almost never talk to someone who is not from India, which is normally not a problem, except when they can't even understand what you're saying the problem is. - Blue screens. About 3 months in they started, eventually getting so frequent the computer was unusable. HP has replaced (supposedly) everything in it, from the motherboard to hard drive to memory. Still blue screens. Overall, I would NEVER buy this computer again.",1
HP TouchSmart tx2z Customizable Notebook PC,"In April of 2008 I purchased the predecessor to the TX2 ( the TX2000). A couple of months after the warranty expired, I began to have spontaneous reboots and video problems and finally it became unusable. I contacted the HP support desk, via their online chat, and after all trouble shooting was completed, I was informed that the machine would need to be sent in for repair, to the tune of $400. I now have an $1100 dollar brick on my desk. A bit of research found that there are thousands of people in the same boat, with HP laptops that have failed in the same manner. The problem is with the Nvidia graphic processing unit (GPU). It runs so hot that the solder connections between it and the main board fail. My GPU would run over 212 degrees F and the exhaust from the cooling fans was 157 degrees F. Although Nvidia notified HP of the failing GPUs sometime in the later part of 2007 or the early part of 2008, HP continued to sell the defective laptops. Their solution was to issue a BIOS update that ran the cooling fans all of the time, which served to increase the life of the GPU, until the computer was out of warranty. You may be thinking the $400 dollar repair is a fair price to fix the laptop, so what is this guy whining about? Well, they are doing the repairs with the exact same parts that failed in the first place, so the problem is occurring again, just a few months after the repair. In short, be sure to factor the cost of the longest extended warranty into the cost of the computer, because after the 1 year warranty expires you are on your own. HP is not going to stand behind their product, even if they know they are selling defective units.",1

"Apple iPad (first generation) MB292LL/A Tablet (16GB, Wifi)","I was actually very surprised how good of shape this 1st generation IPad was in. Not one scratch on the screen or case, it is ofcourse a little out of date but functions perfectly. It had one vey small ding on the case but that is totally understandable for the age of the IPad. I use it solely for playing an old Infocom text game called ZORK and I could not be happier. 👍",2
"Apple iPad (first generation) MB292LL/A Tablet (16GB, Wifi)","I've now spent the better part of a day playing with the new iPad, and while it excels in many things there are still some things anyone considering buying one should probably keep in mind. First the good sides: This thing is very fast, opening and closing applications is quick, the screen is incredibly responsive, there is no lag while typing, and the built in Safari browser does a great job of quickly loading even graphic intense pages. The not so good sides: As has been thoroughly pointed out, there is not presently much in the way of multitasking within the iPhone OS, but with most expectations pointing towards a summer release of OS 4.0 this might be remedied by mid summer, and almost certainly by a generation 2 release. That said, it should be kept in mind that on such a little screen being able to view multiple applications at once will likely never be something you'll use, and the speed by which you can open and close applications makes this less a headache than you might think. It isn't as fast as moving between open apps, but it isn't a deal breaker by any means. The lack of a camera in this generation is a little surprising, while I've purchased my iPad already, I honestly believe that with the number of competitors expected over the course of 2010 we're probably going to see a generation 2 by Christmas with a camera. It's still an amazing device, but the ability to video chat with it would definitely put it over the top, that's a feature worth waiting for. The lack of Flash support isn't as irritating as I expected it to be, but still something to consider. Many major sites have evolved to html5, or are in the process of doing so. This allows for full viewing by the Safari browser, and where it exists, it works great. The remaining sites still using Flash show up with annoying little boxes looking for a plugin that is likely never going to exist. If you spend a lot of time on flash heavy sites it really probably is worth considering holding out to see how the Slate/Android Tablets look in a few months, but if you're mostly just e-mailing and checking facebook (no Farmville) the lack of Flash support probably won't bother you too much. As a laptop replacement: The inclusion of the iWorks utilities gives this device a little bit of a laptop personality. Don't let that persuade you into believing that you don't need a computer though. You might be able to get away with ditching a laptop if all you really do is e-mail or very light word processing, but if you do anything more than that you'll like the freedom and ease a full computer offers for more complex tasks. That said, this device is a tremendous leap towards a future tablet style device that may very well be a replacement for your computer, but for now it is more of a casual use device than something you can really expect to do substantial work with. I have put together a presentation in keynote, which was easy enough to do, but pages isn't as intuitive as I'd have liked, and taking lengthy notes or writing long letters/e-mails/reports will probably make it worth considering buying either the keyboard dock or the wireless bluetooth keyboard. Battery life seems to live up to the claims, I managed to get about 7 hours before getting the 20% remaining battery life indication, which puts it about right for 10 hours or so of total use. One very important thing to realize about charging the device is that presently (at launch) there is some issues with charging via USB from many computers. The iPad is different than other iPod products, it requires a bit more power to charge up, and unfortunately most USB ports aren't set up to support that higher power draw. This is something that may be fixed in a firmware update to allow for a slower charge, or it may simply be that you'll need to either rely on a new Mac (seems like they can handle the power issue) or rely on the wall charger. Just don't be surprised if you plug it into your computer and it doesn't show that it is charging. All in all, the iPad is an impressive device that might make for a reasonable replacement of a netbook for casual users. For people who need something to really do a lot of work on, you may find that for the price that a netbook or laptop still offers the better value for your needs. Future generations of this device will probably transition into fitting that market better than this first generation. However, if you're an avid reader, casual gamer, music fan, who doesn't do much more on the web than check a few sites, and e-mail. This thing is definitely worth considering! If you're on the fence, nothing about this product is so incredible as to justify running out and buying one right now, but it is worthy of your consideration if you're thinking you might like a tablet style device. I definitely would encourage you to go play with one at best buy or an apple store to get a feel for it. With a number of competitors due out over the next few months we're likely to see some price movement, or a second generation release, so it may be worth it to wait it out a little while. One final note, the screen is absolutely gorgeous while it is turned on. It is crisp, bright, and very easy to see from any angle. But when you turn it off, every finger print and swipe is suddenly very visible (while it is on the light is bright enough you don't see them fingerprints). If you are a neat freak, or just hate finger prints on your devices you'll have to invest in some microfiber cloths or get used to using your shirt sleeve! In conclusion, it's a lot of fun, and I'm not the least bit sorry to have bought one. It does many things, and over the next months will do many more. If you think you want one, go play with one, and if you don't want to wait for a next generation this one is definitely awesome. If you have specific needs that aren't really addressed in this generation or by apple, don't let the hype or peer pressure bully you into this one, there are a number of devices coming with great potential, one of those might be a better fit.",2

"Apple iPad (first generation) MB292LL/A Tablet (16GB, Wifi)","BUYER BEWARE. The issue here is that the generation 1 iPad is no longer supported by most applications. We purchased it for a senior family member to use Facebook only. But the Facebook app is not functional on anything less than 7.1 iOS. The generation 1 operates with 5.1 and cannot be upgraded. I then attempted to install the Kindle app with not success. A tablet without usable apps is useless. Amazon should not be offering this product without adequate warnings in large type. By the way, I purchased it as a Christmas present in early November so did not know of the generation 1 issues until Christmas after the 30 day return policy. Again, BUYER BEWARE on older Apple products like this.",2

Because the old version and can not be updated. Buy carefully,2
"Apple iPad (first generation) MB292LL/A Tablet (16GB, Wifi)","We received iPad in good order, however, due to the OS only 5.1.1, nothing works. No games for this OS, it tells us to upgrade to 6 or 7 to get games. But we can't because the 5.1 is the highest level this iPad can use. So using the Internet is out also. Pages will not load due to the os. Very disappointed and will return.",2
"Apple iPad (first generation) MB292LL/A Tablet (16GB, Wifi)","Apple refuses to upgrade the OS on old devices like this, so it's a dinosaur and is incompatible or shoddy at best with most apps and websites.

"Apple iPad (first generation) MB292LL/A Tablet (16GB, Wifi)","There are a lot of complains here about not being able to install many apps on iPad 1st gen. Come on, people, it says in the description - WILL NOT UPDATE PAST iOS 5.1.1!!!! And even though many apps require iOS6 or 7, if you need it just for basic things like internet, mail, eBooks and a few other things like Sudoku or Chess - it works fine. If you have some other things in mind - make sure that it will work for you BEFORE YOU BUY IT! Make sure that the apps you might need will work with iOS5. The rule of thumb - if you need it for more than basics - don;t buy it! It has no camera nor mic, so no pictures/videos taking, no Skype, no audio recording. I bought it for my wife as eReader and even though at first it didn't let me install iBooks (Error: iOS 7 required!) I found a little trick on the internet, how to get the older version: 1) install itunes on your PC, download iBooks there, sync iTunes with the iPad. 2) disconnect iPad from PC. If you don't see iBooks on your iPad, download it through the AppStore on your iPad - and THEN you will get the message that it requires iOS7 and the option to download older, compatible version of the iBooks. If you just try to install iBooks through the AppStore (without step 1), it won't give you the option of older version, just Error message. People say that this trick can be used to download older versions of some other apps as well (Facebook for inst.), so give it a try.",2
"Asus Eee PC T91 8.9-Inch Intel Atom Netbook Tablet Computer (Black), Windows XP, T91SA-VU1X-BK","This is a great little PC. I use it for taking notes in class and just general computing and internet access. I have installed a full install of MS Office on it, as well as a number of other programs including Firefox 3.5, IrfanView, VLC, and other open source software. The touch features are decent, and the screen is very accurate. I haven't had to recalibrate it since purchase a few weeks ago. I also like the flip feature to turn it in true a true tablet. I really like the button that allows you to turn the screen orientation. To help with text entry while I'm in tablet mode, I put the windows onscreen keyboard in the quick start menu. The only drawback with this computer is the lag. Even during the typing of this review, it has lagged once or twice. I'll type and it will back up a little bit and then spit out all of the letters at once. I tolerate this just fine, because the computer is otherwise perfect for my uses. I also find issues with playing youtube videos, where it takes a while for the video to buffer in the computer so that the video doesn't jump. This is not an internet connection issue, but a computer issue. One myth I would like to dispell - the keyboard is quite typable. I use the keyboard for taking notes in class, and can touch type very easily. It took a little bit to get used to the tab, caps lock, and backspace keys, but other than that, it's wonderful and easy to type on at full speed. I purchased the package with the 2gb ram upgrade and the external optical drive, which in my opinion was worth it. The whole package was under 600 bucks from amazon - the other dealers sometimes price the computer itself at 600. Order from amazon, even if they're out of stock. They'll send you one when they get it in.",4
"Asus Eee PC T91 8.9-Inch Intel Atom Netbook Tablet Computer (Black), Windows XP, T91SA-VU1X-BK","I have this to say about the PC t91: It lasts! My wife has been using hers daily for about 3 years and it never quits. She used to have a lot of lock-ups when using IE as the web browser, but switched to Chrome and seldom has to restart her computer. It is light-weight and portable. She never tries to run videos on it (other than YouTube). She frequently has used it for music and it has performed flawlessly. If you can find one of these around, it is WELL WORTH the investment for web browsing and other light use. 21Feb13 Update. Still running strong. She uses it daily, mostly for Kindle, web-browsing, email, and Facebook. NEVER fails. The best microelectronics investment I ever made.",4
"Asus Eee PC T91 8.9-Inch Intel Atom Netbook Tablet Computer (Black), Windows XP, T91SA-VU1X-BK","I primarily wanted something small and light, but with a real keyboard, for editing documents when I travel. I wanted a Windows-based system, as I've had less than satisfactory results trying to edit Word docs with other OSs like Chrome. I've also found Windows 8 frustrating to use for several reasons. Being somewhat of an old fogey, the last version of Windows I really felt comfortable with was XP, so I prefer using that. I've had this little gem for over a month now and love it! The only negative thing I can say about it is that the keyboard is smaller than a standard keyboard so that my typing speed suffers a bit because of that. But I'm learning to compensate for that, and it's definitely not a deal breaker. If you're someone who has to have the latest and greatest, then this isn't for you. But if you just want something that gets the job done, then I highly recommend this. It also has excellent battery life, and accommodates a USB mouse as well as memory sticks.",4
"Asus Eee PC T91 8.9-Inch Intel Atom Netbook Tablet Computer (Black), Windows XP, T91SA-VU1X-BK",I am really happy with my Asus Eee PC T91. The keyboard is perfect for my wrists (I have thin hands and long fingers). I love it so much I have bought a replacement battery and went through the long involved process of installing it (it is not user accessible) with the help of a youtube video. It is now a lot heavier than it used to be. Probably because everything else has gotten lighter and so now it seems more cumbersome. It does have a problem with the screen. The left fifth of the screen looks like it has an overlay of a transparent magenta. It has been that way since a short while after I got it. It just wasn't worth it to me to deal with doing something about it. About two years ago it lost the ability to notice when the lid was closed so it didn't go to sleep on its own. Now I just use the zzz function before I close it. It is old and this is a minor thing compared to what else could go wrong.,4
"Asus Eee PC T91 8.9-Inch Intel Atom Netbook Tablet Computer (Black), Windows XP, T91SA-VU1X-BK","Order was placed on 10/24/2010 and shipped 10/25/2010. Merchandise delivered on 10/27/2010 as promised. Absolutely no regrets with my order. The price was the driving force behind my purchase. SD card and card slot became defective and I had to returned it. Amazon exceeded my expectations with their handling of my replacement unit and return authorization. Enough to make them my primary online retailer for all further purchases. I upgraded the memory to 2GB. Although the 1GB chip seem adequate, I preferred the added memory for better performance. This unit shipped with Windows XP and I am impressed with the overall touch performance in general, especially considering that it is a resistive touch screen. Being a Computer Science Major who is almost finish with my degree requirements, I installed Windows 7 (free) under the Academic Alliance Program with the community college that I am enrolled in. I am running a dual boot (Windows XP and Windows 7) from the 16GB SSD. Windows XP handles well and is the primary focus. The computer is small, lightweight, and is ideal for portability. Functionality is great and is a good alternative to the IPAD. Since showing off some of it's features and functionalities, I have had several colleagues order the same computer from Amazon. I gave it only four stars solely because of the small hard drive (despite the 16GB SSD card and 20GB of free online storage). Definitely a good value for the money.",4
Rocstor Arcticroc 2T 4TB USB 2.0/eSATA/FW400/FW800 Dual Bay Raid Tower System for Pc and Mac,"I am very sorry I bought this product. The Raid 0 quit working and after replacing both drives it still reads very slowly. Perhaps it is something wrong with the ArcticRoc itself, but the new drives are both in perfect working order. After many phone calls to the support number, I have given up. I only reached a human one time in over a dozen calls, and he tried to help but with his heavy accent and constant interruptions with other calls --I was put on hold numerous times--he failed to solve the problem. I will try now to return the product for some kind of refund. All in all, not something I'd wish on my worst enemy. Several days after posting the above review, I got an unexpected phone call from technical support at Rocstor, and the fellow who helped me could not have been MORE helpful. All problems got solved. Let me briefly mention the issue here, because it is NOT covered in the user manual for Arcticroc 2T: When and if you need to replace and rebuild ONE bad drive in the RAID 1 mirrored setting, you must FIRST power up Arcticroc with the ONE good drive in it, THEN, WITH THE POWER ON, insert the new hard drive into whichever bay is open. If you do all of this with the power OFF, the computer is NOT going to mount the Arctiroc correctly because it is confused about which drive to read. All that said, I am now a happy customer and wish to upgrade my rating to 4.5 stars (I know, either 4 or 5 please!)",2

Penpower Handwriter Lohas Chinese Handwriting Tablet,"Not reliable, not a trouble free product.",2
Penpower Handwriter Lohas Chinese Handwriting Tablet,"I bought this directly from penpower since Amazon didn't carry it at the time. I've used it on a PowerMac G5 running OS X 10.5.8 with two monitors. At one point it worked pretty well, though not nearly as well as the handwriting built into higher-end versions of Windows 7. The strokes are not as smooth, the recognition of poorly drawn characters is not as forgiving, editing is harder. Also, the tablet is not quite calibrated correctly and there's no way to adjust the calibration. This is a minor annoyance. Recently when I've used it I've had two big problems. First, the screen cursor doesn't track the pen when you hover it above the tablet. Second, when trying to use full screen input I got a spinning beachball cursor and was unable to get control back. I had to reset my Mac. It' been years since I've had my Mac crash like this. I probably should uninstall and reinstall and try again, but I don't think it's worth the effort. This may work better with an Intel mac, or if you don't have have two screens. It doesn't work for me. Chinese handwriting may work with Apple's Magic Trackpad. If it's like the Chinese input on the iPhone, it will be worthwhile.",2

"Apple iPad (First Generation) MC349LL/A Tablet (16GB, Wifi + 3G)","I've now spent the better part of a day playing with the new iPad, and while it excels in many things there are still some things anyone considering buying one should probably keep in mind. First the good sides: This thing is very fast, opening and closing applications is quick, the screen is incredibly responsive, there is no lag while typing, and the built in Safari browser does a great job of quickly loading even graphic intense pages. The not so good sides: As has been thoroughly pointed out, there is not presently much in the way of multitasking within the iPhone OS, but with most expectations pointing towards a summer release of OS 4.0 this might be remedied by mid summer, and almost certainly by a generation 2 release. That said, it should be kept in mind that on such a little screen being able to view multiple applications at once will likely never be something you'll use, and the speed by which you can open and close applications makes this less a headache than you might think. It isn't as fast as moving between open apps, but it isn't a deal breaker by any means. The lack of a camera in this generation is a little surprising, while I've purchased my iPad already, I honestly believe that with the number of competitors expected over the course of 2010 we're probably going to see a generation 2 by Christmas with a camera. It's still an amazing device, but the ability to video chat with it would definitely put it over the top, that's a feature worth waiting for. The lack of Flash support isn't as irritating as I expected it to be, but still something to consider. Many major sites have evolved to html5, or are in the process of doing so. This allows for full viewing by the Safari browser, and where it exists, it works great. The remaining sites still using Flash show up with annoying little boxes looking for a plugin that is likely never going to exist. If you spend a lot of time on flash heavy sites it really probably is worth considering holding out to see how the Slate/Android Tablets look in a few months, but if you're mostly just e-mailing and checking facebook (no Farmville) the lack of Flash support probably won't bother you too much. As a laptop replacement: The inclusion of the iWorks utilities gives this device a little bit of a laptop personality. Don't let that persuade you into believing that you don't need a computer though. You might be able to get away with ditching a laptop if all you really do is e-mail or very light word processing, but if you do anything more than that you'll like the freedom and ease a full computer offers for more complex tasks. That said, this device is a tremendous leap towards a future tablet style device that may very well be a replacement for your computer, but for now it is more of a casual use device than something you can really expect to do substantial work with. I have put together a presentation in keynote, which was easy enough to do, but pages isn't as intuitive as I'd have liked, and taking lengthy notes or writing long letters/e-mails/reports will probably make it worth considering buying either the keyboard dock or the wireless bluetooth keyboard. Battery life seems to live up to the claims, I managed to get about 7 hours before getting the 20% remaining battery life indication, which puts it about right for 10 hours or so of total use. One very important thing to realize about charging the device is that presently (at launch) there is some issues with charging via USB from many computers. The iPad is different than other iPod products, it requires a bit more power to charge up, and unfortunately most USB ports aren't set up to support that higher power draw. This is something that may be fixed in a firmware update to allow for a slower charge, or it may simply be that you'll need to either rely on a new Mac (seems like they can handle the power issue) or rely on the wall charger. Just don't be surprised if you plug it into your computer and it doesn't show that it is charging.

"Apple iPad (First Generation) MC497LL/A Tablet (64GB, Wifi + 3G)","BUYER BEWARE. The issue here is that the generation 1 iPad is no longer supported by most applications. We purchased it for a senior family member to use Facebook only. But the Facebook app is not functional on anything less than 7.1 iOS. The generation 1 operates with 5.1 and cannot be upgraded. I then attempted to install the Kindle app with not success. A tablet without usable apps is useless. Amazon should not be offering this product without adequate warnings in large type. By the way, I purchased it as a Christmas present in early November so did not know of the generation 1 issues until Christmas after the 30 day return policy. Again, BUYER BEWARE on older Apple products like this.",2
"Apple iPad (First Generation) MC497LL/A Tablet (64GB, Wifi + 3G)",This is no longer supported by Apple iPad Version 5.1 is only available for iPad You may not download programs or newly Games Most of the applications in the Apple Store requires the issuance of ios 8 or higher You can take advantage of the iPad just to watch YouTube only Games and applications not supported by the device. Because the old version and can not be updated. Buy carefully,2
"Apple iPad (First Generation) MC497LL/A Tablet (64GB, Wifi + 3G)","We received iPad in good order, however, due to the OS only 5.1.1, nothing works. No games for this OS, it tells us to upgrade to 6 or 7 to get games. But we can't because the 5.1 is the highest level this iPad can use. So using the Internet is out also. Pages will not load due to the os. Very disappointed and will return.",2
"Apple iPad (First Generation) MC497LL/A Tablet (64GB, Wifi + 3G)","Apple refuses to upgrade the OS on old devices like this, so it's a dinosaur and is incompatible or shoddy at best with most apps and websites. You are very limited in what you can do with these, I'd recommend NOT getting one , or any Apple products at all, as Apple is well known for screwing over customers by rendering devices that would otherwise work fine inoperable with their limited upgrade policies.",2
"Apple iPad (First Generation) MC497LL/A Tablet (64GB, Wifi + 3G)","There are a lot of complains here about not being able to install many apps on iPad 1st gen. Come on, people, it says in the description - WILL NOT UPDATE PAST iOS 5.1.1!!!! And even though many apps require iOS6 or 7, if you need it just for basic things like internet, mail, eBooks and a few other things like Sudoku or Chess - it works fine. If you have some other things in mind - make sure that it will work for you BEFORE YOU BUY IT! Make sure that the apps you might need will work with iOS5. The rule of thumb - if you need it for more than basics - don;t buy it! It has no camera nor mic, so no pictures/videos taking, no Skype, no audio recording. I bought it for my wife as eReader and even though at first it didn't let me install iBooks (Error: iOS 7 required!) I found a little trick on the internet, how to get the older version: 1) install itunes on your PC, download iBooks there, sync iTunes with the iPad. 2) disconnect iPad from PC. If you don't see iBooks on your iPad, download it through the AppStore on your iPad - and THEN you will get the message that it requires iOS7 and the option to download older, compatible version of the iBooks. If you just try to install iBooks through the AppStore (without step 1), it won't give you the option of older version, just Error message. People say that this trick can be used to download older versions of some other apps as well (Facebook for inst.), so give it a try.",2
"HP tm2t Tablet PC - Windows 7 Professional, Intel SU9600 1.60GHz, 8GB Memory, 640GB Hard Drive, External DVD+/-RW, 12.1"" Touch-screen","Hello, I have the unique blessing of owning one of these extravagant HP Touchsmart TM2T tablet laptops. I bought mine back in May, 2010, and I bought mine brand new via Ebay store. I disagree with this seller's price, however, because my TM2T has almost the exact same specs as his does, and I paid only $800 for mine. Actually the price was $780, but with S&H, it came to the $800. The only thing mine doesn't have that this one has is the ATI dedicated graphics. I did some research on this switchable graphics option on this TM2T tablet laptop, and to be honest, unless a person is a dedicated gamer or does some very serious graphic arts or someting like that, having the ATI switchable graphics will not make much difference. Plus, it drains the battery life. I got the basic Intel integrated HD graphics on my TM2T, and I can play and do the same high end games and the same extreme graphics as one with ATI can do. Instead of burning my cash up on something that I probably wouldn't ever need, I decided to spend an extra $300 shortly after I got my TM2T, and I bought me the full 8 GB brand new memory. Now the memory to me is very useful because I am a Netflix/video buff. With the 8 gigs of memory, my TM2T and Netflix run everso smooth. I have watched the most action-packed and most graphic enhanced movies, and they played without flaw, without lag whatsoever, and were bright, sharp, and clear. I'm not saying to Not get the ATI graphics. I love my TM2T so much that I am planning on getting a second one in a month or so, and I do want it to have the ATI dedicated graphics, just for bragging rights. But I know that that is all I will find use for them for. Anyway, the HP Touchsmart TM2T is just dynamitely awesome; it is built with some very high quality, and the speakers, finally, are elegantly placed right where a laptops's speakers should be placed. And the audio quality is the best I have ever heard on a tablet laptop. The keyboard, webcak, dual mics, Bluetooth, connections, and everything else in my TM2T work absolutely flawless and have amazing performance. What I don't understand that some of the people that are selling the TM2T, really jack up the price on it, and they don't even have the highest end processor on theirs. There is no way anyone is going to pay $1500 for a near-base model TM2T tablet laptop when they can go right to Ebay or even to HP's site, configure one with everything plus the latest and greatest processor type, ATI graphics, and everything else and pay much less for it; and with special pricing and coupons and student discounts, they would pay even lesser amount for one brand new and with the highes of every spec available. So you people, such as this seller here, that is selling a near-base model TM2T for a jacked-up price, you need to do some research, and then make your prices quite a bit more reasonable. I got everything on my TM2T that is on this one here Except for the ATI graphics, and I even got the 8 gig of memory recently, and I also bought a super slim super fine HP external DVD Burner which works Extremely well and is the clearest DVD player I have ever saw, and even getting all of this, I paid a much less price than what is being charged here. These people charging like this, really need to compare their prices with others, and come way down,a s I have said! Still though, the TM2T is the absolute best deal for a tablet laptop that is going today. HP has a real winner on their hands with it! Thanks for listening!",5
