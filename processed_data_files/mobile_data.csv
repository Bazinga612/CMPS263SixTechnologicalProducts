Samsung Galaxy S III / SGH-i747 16GB GSM Unlocked LTE Android Smartphone Blue,"Firstly, I'd like to point out that this review is primarily regarding the product received from Tablet Distributors (a featured seller under this listing, posted as New condition). When the item arrived, it was immediately evident that I did not have in front of me the box in the photos. It's technically carrier packaging, but it's a generic box from AT&T, with no printed information on the outside pertaining to this specific phone. The phone inside was in near-perfect condition, save for two very small blemishes that I can't seem to remove from the screen. It may be worth noting that these imperfections were covered loosely by a misaligned factory screen protector with the usual ""don't text and drive"" slogan AT&T is known for. Also, while the charger and battery door (and the phone, itself) seem to be genuine Samsung products, the battery is not. This creates problems when one is trying to get the phone to charge consistently, or to maintain a full charge if you ever do get it to that point. I've since ordered a genuine Samsung dock and spare battery, which comes with a handy one-piece wall charger, instead of the AC adapter/woefully short USB cable combination that comes in the phone's box. This new battery and charger seem to have cured all of my problems with charging, which is definitely a relief for me. The phone itself has proper specifications, as far as I know, to prove it's the exact model that's advertised here. The screen is absolutely beautiful, I must say. HD YouTube videos look flawless, though I may be easy to impress in this respect. I've previously owned a Nokia N900 (lovely phone, broken USB port) and a Motorola Atrix 2. The S3 seems to have so much more potential than these other models. I'm using this phone with Straight Talk and without any trouble. I can't really speak as to whether it's truly unlocked or not, since I've yet to have trouble using AT&T-locked phones on this service which also uses the very same network and towers. I CAN say that it's probably wise to find out which network your prepaid SIM-based service operates on in order to give you the best chance of having the same signal quality available to you. It's also good to know that these phones are capable of wireless charging, with a few accessories you can purchase here on Amazon. This is something that interests me, as I'm a bit paranoid about microUSB ports nowadays. All in all, this seems to be a great phone with enough tech packed inside to keep it feeling current for some time.",3
Samsung Galaxy S III / SGH-i747 16GB GSM Unlocked LTE Android Smartphone Blue,"Anyone considering purchasing this based on the (generic no carrier logo) images shown should be advised the 16gb phone is actually an unlocked att phone (stamped on back plate) and is loaded with un-removable att bloatware that takes up almost 5 gb of memory. After accidentally shattering the screen on my 5 month old T-mobile Galaxy S3, I SPECIFICALLY (foolishly) went with this seller as opposed to another (cheaper) seller because I DID NOT WANT an ATT phone, having dealt with their un-removable bloatware in past eating up huge chunks of memory and batter power; these programs can be 'force stopped.turned off, but restart on next powering on.. I now have basically spent $140 (incl tax) on what is essentially an 8gb phone loaded with battery draining att unneeded, unwanted, useless programs that I absolutely hate. Classic case of buyer beware. -.- Edited to add: Additionally, in examining the phone, although it was sold as 'new', it is clearly USED/REFURBISHED. The lens over the camera is chipped on one side and scratched, and the earphone jack has clearly been used numerous times, as has the usb/charging port at the bottom.",3
Samsung Galaxy S III / SGH-i747 16GB GSM Unlocked LTE Android Smartphone Blue,"It a nice phone. You all know the specs. It does come with a lot of loaded apps that take up plenty space. I must say, you probably should find a case for it. It seems a bit harder to handle than any other phone I've had, so I fumble with it a lot. I think it's a fairly fragile phone. It probably won't handle many small drops. Also, I always seem to turn it on when simply grabbing it or pulling out of my pockets. The buttons, on the side, are very sensitive. It seems like a very capable phone, but I struggle with the arrangement of the power and volume buttons on the side. Battery seems to need recharging 5-7 hours into the day with very little use. And, did I say, it has a lot of bloatware? I am constantly killing apps in order to preserve battery life. So much junk running in the background. I've been a Samsung fan for a long time. It all started with the Galaxy Player 5. That was a great device during that period just before the true smartphone boom. We have 3 Samsung LED TVs, two Galaxy 7inch tablets, a nearly 3.5 year old Galaxy Note 10.1 inch Tablet, a 10 in Galaxy Tab, and 9.7 inch Tab S2. This however is the first of the Galaxy line of phones I've purchased. While I like the look of the phone and the style, I'm not overall impressed with this device. Samsung loaded this with plenty of bloatware and AT&T also loaded it with a ton of crap. This is a late review of course. I just purchased this phone just prior to Christmas (2015), yet this phone has been out for probably 3 years. I liked the hardware specs and it finally fail into price range (approx $200) that I was willing to spend on a phone. I refuse to spend $600+ on a phone because it boast capabilities that I would never use.",3
Samsung Galaxy S III / SGH-i747 16GB GSM Unlocked LTE Android Smartphone Blue,"I am very pleased with the phone we received. It is a genuine Samsung S3. I purchased this for my wife, she took it to the ATT store where they plugged in a sim card and set it up within 5 minutes. No problems at all. It has performed flawlessly even after being dropped on our tile floor. I even like some of the displays better than my S4 which is probably associated with the S3 operating system. The price was in line with other sellers. Breed shipped the phone right away. I had read a number of reviews on this product advertised elsewhere on Amazon and was concerned about receiving a clone or refurbished phone as described by some other buyers (even from the same seller). However, I think that reviews may get bundled under specific product names so I suggest you just be sure what is being advertised for sale by the specific seller. This ad was for a new S3 SGH-I747 (US model) ATT phone and that is exactly what we received.",3
HTC Dash / S620 / S621 (Excalibur) Black Windows WI-FI Smartphone GSM Unlocked T-mobile Cell Phone,"Once I received the product in the mail I fully charged the cell phone before operating it. After a few hours of charging I inserted my sim card and tried browsing. the phone ended up shutting off on me. I turned it back on and decided to send a text. Several buttons for the letters weren't functioning at all, others needed to be tapped a few times just to get it to work. It was extremely aggravating dealing with a phone that was labeled as very good condition. The description of the condition should not have been very good since it was limited in it's functions. I would not purchase another item from this seller!!! false advertising !!!",2
HTC Dash / S620 / S621 (Excalibur) Black Windows WI-FI Smartphone GSM Unlocked T-mobile Cell Phone,"I purchased this phone thinking it was brand new in the Tmobile box, but it was refurbished. I purchased this for a Christmas gift and only 4 months after the purchase THE PHONE DOES NOT WORK. I am very disappointed and would appreciate a refund of my $75, but everyone knows that will never happen. Just be warned that you are not getting a decent phone and you will only have a working phone for a couple of months.",2
HTC Dash / S620 / S621 (Excalibur) Black Windows WI-FI Smartphone GSM Unlocked T-mobile Cell Phone,Phone looked good and arrived on time,2
HTC Dash / S620 / S621 (Excalibur) Black Windows WI-FI Smartphone GSM Unlocked T-mobile Cell Phone,"This phone is the biggest piece of junk I have ever seen. The unit itself is built solid as a rock, very durable but once you turn it on and try to use the features you are quickly frustrated by the lack of user friendliness and the terrible lack of memory. You constantly have to go into task manager, thats right task manager (this is a miniature version of the windows that you use on your computer) and close tasks to get the camera to function. If you have one too many things open it won't work AND when you exit back to the home screen the phone does not automatically close Apps you were using, they stay running in the backround and have to manually be closed in task manager. The keyboard was an awkward size for my fingers and to send a text you have to go to MESSAGES, then MENU, then select the type of message, E mail or SMS or MMS, THEN you have to go to folders and select NEW. It a 3 or 4 step process just to text vs just hitting an icon and going to town. The camera takes decent pics for a low pix unit but like I said you have to make sure you keep the memory clear. It's just a terrible operating system, totally inefficiant. I definitely would not recommend this phone.The dust cover for the charging port broke off the second day. I have already returned mine.",2
HTC Dash / S620 / S621 (Excalibur) Black Windows WI-FI Smartphone GSM Unlocked T-mobile Cell Phone,I was going to hook it up with T-mobile because the phone is for t-mobile. They pissed me off with a line of poop and told them what to do with there service So it is still in the box DONE!,2
HTC Dash / S620 / S621 (Excalibur) Black Windows WI-FI Smartphone GSM Unlocked T-mobile Cell Phone,"I chose a 5 star rate for this seller because they stand behind what they sell. If there is any problem they resolve it quickly and go beyond good customer service, they give GREAT customer service. I will be dealing with them again!",2
HTC Dash / S620 / S621 (Excalibur) Black Windows WI-FI Smartphone GSM Unlocked T-mobile Cell Phone,It never worked,2
HTC Dash / S620 / S621 (Excalibur) Black Windows WI-FI Smartphone GSM Unlocked T-mobile Cell Phone,"Phone arrived in good condition worked well when I insert the sim card but the battery runs out fast. Lo único que no me gusto es que llegó solo con el cargador y no tenía manos libres, ni el cable para conectarlo a la computadora pero aparte de eso es un buen teléfono que hasta ahora no ha dado problemas.",2
Motorola i95cl Phone (Nextel),"It's been 3 weeks now and I've only had minor voice mail setup issues. The phone itself is the best I've had in years. Clear calls and it gets signals where my previous AT&T service would not. My guess is that this is partly due to the good Nextel coverage my area gets. As for the phone...I did not particularly like the v60 series. My flip seemed cheap and I broke the antenna really easily. This phone feels much stronger and better constructed. Lucky for me all of my v-series accessories fit, so there were no extra purchases needed. I'll see what 6 months to a year brings.",4
Motorola i95cl Phone (Nextel),"I've only had this phone a few weeks but so far i love it. The internet connection is so much faster than any other phone i've had. Nextel's customer service has been fantastic so far with set up and number porting. This phone is durable and surpisingly comfortable. The speaker phone is wonderful, ive used it twice and works great. The only thing that this phone could use, is a quick alarm. You have to use the calendar feature to set an appt and reminder in order to use your phone as an alarm. Other than that...it's the best phone and service i've ever had.",4
Motorola i95cl Phone (Nextel),"I've been a Nextel customer for years for both business and personal use. I've used almost all lines of phones. The i95cl was my favorite until i830 came along. The i95 is good for casual and especially heavy business users. The color LCD screen is huge compared to i730 and i830. Apparently Nextel had to reduce screen size in order to reduce phone size. That is one thing I miss in i830. I never had a problem with i95 size since it weighs about 5 oz. Great phone and I could not believe Nextel would discontinue it. *Note: I have an extra i95 for sale. It was my personal phone and in very good condition with some scratches. It is fully operational, travel charger and holster, shipping in USA included for flat $120.00. I will accept paypal only. Please email me if interested at leel1@netscape.com.",4
Motorola i95cl Phone (Nextel),"Great phone alot better then sprint! Setting it up with the 800 # Well let's say pack a LUNCH! It took me 4 hours on the phone, and six different people to get connected! They need alot of work on that! After all said and done great phone, great coverage, walkie talkie feature breaks up now and then, but is really quick talking back and forth.No alarm clock? would be nice! if had to activate again would take it to a nextel dealer to do it instead of calling it in! nice pic on colored screen, games look nice.thinking of an upgrade to the i730, GPS but no alarm clock? a full feature phone with GPS to take you anywhere but NO alarm clock to wake you up when your there? I go camping and 4 wheeling where the GPS would come in handy and so would the ALARM CLOCK! think they might get the message and make it a downloadable feature! HOPE THIS HELPS!",4
Motorola i95cl Phone (Nextel),"What do you want from your phone? I'm a bit of a gadget geek, so I wanted it all. I wanted text messaging, a large color screen, web access, AOL AIM access, Java-based games, you name it. So, I was willing to shell out the big bucks when it came to getting a phone. I got the i95cl about a year ago, and I've been very satisfied with the phone's performance. I'm not as satisfied with Nextel, though, who you have to get service from to get this phone. All the features you could ever want are there, but you're going to pay for them. Web access costs money, text messaging costs money, caller ID costs money... they nickle and dime you for all the features on their network. They have package deals, which is what I use, where it's $15 a month for all their internet access features, which makes it reasonably affordable, but if you're looking for a cheap phone and a cheap monthly bill, you won't get it with this phone, and with Nextel. Now, back to the phone. Here are the pros: - Pretty good battery life (I charge every 2 to 3 days). - Very sturdy design, unlike several phones I've owned before. The antenna is tough, and so is the case. Dropping it won't break it. - Loud and clear sound, and a built in speakerphone. - Color screen, which is nice for looking at web sites, or playing the Java games... which leads us to... - Built in Java engine which allows you to download applications from Nextel right onto the phone. Games, business applications, notepads, there are lots of fun java tools to play with. Some are free, and some you have to pay for. - Nextel Direct Connect, which you can only use to talk to other Nextel customers, but the phone functions as a walkie-talkie, and it's very convenient. - Internet access, allowing you to text message, instant message, receive emails, and browse the web (text only). - Voice activated dialing, which is convenient. - Amazing coverage. I have service inside buildings when no one else does. The antenna picks up signals well, and Nextel has great coverage. This is all well and good, you say, but what are the drawbacks? There are a few cons to this phone: - Size. Man, is this a big phone. I have a holster on my belt, it really isn't ""pocket sized"". To get a nice big screen, and durability, you have to sacrifice size. - Cost. As I said before, the phone is expensive, and so are all the cool little extras. You probably will be paying $50/mo for this phone. - Web access is text only, which is unfortunate, as some new phones are entering the market with real graphical web browsing. So, like I said at the beginning of this review, what do you want from your phone? If you're willing to pay for it, this phone has it all. It's a little big, and a little costy, but I've been in love with it for a year now, and I don't think I'll be trading phones any time soon.",4
Siemens SX56 - Smartphone - GSM - touch - Windows Mobile - AT&T,"I needed something that combines a PDA and a Mobile phone, Siemens SX56 provides both . If you're thinking of combined PDA-Phone functionality,this is the product of choice. Stable battery capacity.",3
Siemens SX56 - Smartphone - GSM - touch - Windows Mobile - AT&T,"This is an excellent choice if you need to do lots of email and sometimes check attachments while on the road. Also good for sms and messenger, as it is easier to input text in the screen with the stylus than with the tiny keys of regular phones. But if your needs are more about reading email (not answering it) and having calendar and contacts synchcronized with your server or PC, a smartphone or any other new generation phone is a bettter choice because of the form factor. The big size is a price you have to be willing to pay for the luxury of working confortable in a bigger screen. Agree with all the other reviews, the AT&T service is bad, but I have found that this phone has much better reception than the Orange smartphone and Motorola smartphones in the AT&T network. If you are a frequent Intl traveler, be aware this is not a tri band phone... check the networks of the places you travel more frequently before buying this.",3
Siemens SX56 - Smartphone - GSM - touch - Windows Mobile - AT&T,"AT&T uses two frequencies for GSM service. Originally they only used GSM1900 but as the old analog and TDA 850 MHz networks are made obsolete they are being converted to GSM850. The SX56 supports GSM1900 (and GSM900 for roaming in Europe) but not the newer GSM850 service. As time goes on AT&T will enhance their GSM850 coverage but there are reports that they've done all they're going to do to improve GSM1900 coverage. So if you're lucky your service will be OK but if you have any signal issues with this phone it won't get any better I have the TMobile version of this phone and it works well on the TMobile network since TMobile only uses GSM1900 across North America. But this SX56 version of the phone is sold ""locked"" to only operate on AT&T's network. This is a problem with many AT&T GSM phones but it's particularly an issue with the SX56 because there aren't any suitable replacements (yet) with comparable functionality that support GSM850.",3
Siemens SX56 - Smartphone - GSM - touch - Windows Mobile - AT&T,"I bought two of these, one for my wife and one for me. It was so large, heavy, and difficult to use the numbers to dial the phone, my wife didn't like hers. Therefore, when the VERY FRAGILE glass on the screen broke on mine after 5 months, I took hers. The glass broke on the seconed one after 3 months. I was just using it for normal calendar checking and phone calls - nothing rough. Stay away from this phone. BTW, it cost me $100 to purchase and they quoted $300 to repair. ATT doesn't sell them anymore.",3
Siemens SX56 - Smartphone - GSM - touch - Windows Mobile - AT&T,"Terrific phone for business folks on the go. All the connectivity and apps you need in one hand. let me take that back. you actually do need 2 hands for perfect performance. That is the only thing I do miss. But am willing to sacrifice due to the great display. Was lost in Jersey last week, connected to internet, found directions and phone to the location, made the call and then was able to jot down notes. Hopefully with Cingular trying to acquire ATT it will speed up the improvement of the GSM service coverage. As you all know ATT is spotty, when the coverage is good it is good when it ain't it is horrible. Would recommend this phone to anyone who wants to eliminate their PDA, synch with outlook, and access email/internet while on the go. Would have been 5 stars if ATT service was better. But let's admit it, they all stink.",3
Siemens SX56 - Smartphone - GSM - touch - Windows Mobile - AT&T,"I bought this phone directly from AT&T for 99.00 USD. And I love it, recently Siemens posted free upgrade to WM 2003. The best feature which I like during my limited use (less than week) is to take notes while talking to someone. I dont think this is possible in any other phone (unless you have PDA phone). Reception of AT&T in my area is pretty good so no issue with coverage. The only reason for giving 4 star is less memory and little bit big size than normal phone (but yes this is not a normal phone).",3
Siemens SX56 - Smartphone - GSM - touch - Windows Mobile - AT&T,"I love my sx56, I have taken it everywhere, snowboarding, skydiving, beach, everywhere. Mine has never broken, in fact it is the sturdiest cell phone I've ever owned. Once I upgraded it to the Windows Mobile 2003 OS it was even better. All the cool standard software was great. Plus I added the Microsoft Voice Command software and can make calls to all my outlook contacts by pushing one button and saying ""Call so and so home"", you don't even have to train or record the voice commands, it does it all by voice recognition!",3
Siemens SX56 - Smartphone - GSM - touch - Windows Mobile - AT&T,"I've owned this phone for about 18 months and if I hadn't paid so much for it I would have taken a hammer to it long ago. Even in the center of a large town I get lousy signal strength; people can't hear me and I can't hear them. The PDA works well and I bought it so I could carry my calendar and contacts with me and dial them directly with one tap...nice features, well worth the $700+ I paid...IF I could get a signal. Now I have learned this is because this phone doesn't work on the ""third"" GSM band.",3
PCS Phone Sanyo SCP-8100 (Sprint),"The sanyo 8100 is the flagship phone for Sprint's PCS network, with a plethora of features and lots of style points. As far as I know this phone will ONLY work with SPRINT - so keep that in mind. This is probably the reason many reviewers have chosen to factor the sprint service into thier ratings and into their reviews, which makes some sense, however keep in mind that the quality of service given by a particular provider varies greatly by region. When first looking at the phone you'll notice it's very compact, and also very stylish. the design is top notch, it not only looks good but is very functional. The flip (clam shell) design is put to good use, with a smaller LCD on the outside and a main LCD on the inside. Both of these displays are color and fairly crisp. The outter LCD is used for caller ID as well as displaying wristwatch-like info (time, signal strength etc) while not being used. Buttons are a bit cumbersome for people with big fingers... but that's the case with most cell phones anyway. Navigating the menus is fairly intuitive, although entering letters and characters in the dark is a problem. This phone is PACKED with features. You can browse the web in full color. However to anyone who hasnt used the web on a cell phone yet, dont expect an experience ANYWHERE near what you get on your computer. The small screen and akward charachetr input methods make surfing the www less of a hobby and more of a chore. That said this feature can be immensley useful. The phone has a built in camera, which takes decent, albeit small, photos. You can then email these pictures to friends straight form the phone, or you can opt to use them as ""photo caller id"" (the picture will display on the LCD when a certain person in your phone book calls. You can also customize your phone with full color wallpaper, animated characters, nice sounding polyphonic ringers, and a variety of games - all downloadable on the net, some for a cost however. There's also some built in aps such as a calendar with limited PIM functionality, a phone book that can store upto 300 entries, each with upto 7 numbers, an email addy and a web addy, there's a calculator, a world clock, and you can download aditional aps to provide a whole number of other uses and features (such as aps that use the phone's location features to give ""onstar"" like functionality). Of course there is text messaging, voice memos, and a bunch more. You can use the web through sprint's PCS vision service to send/recieve email, or log onto AIM, MSN messenger, or yahoo messenger. This is a great convenience, but seeing as how none of these interfaces are very user friendly, and character typing is a pain - you'll quickly realise that this is more for use when you need to tell someone something really quick rather than recreational chatting. With AIM, the messages take a long time to load and it's a bit tedious to use because of the web based interface - too bad there isnt a downloadable ap for it, or built in capabillities, either or which would have improved performance vastly. The phone's battery life is good, but not great, happily thanks to the travel charger you can talk while the phone is plugged in and/or charging. The antena extends to help you get a better signal, and the phone works on both digital and analog networks for roaming. The ringer and reciever are loud, which is good. A number of settings will probably overwhelm you at first, but offers a lot of power and flexabillity. The only draw back is that the phone is directly tied to sprint, so if you dont like sprint, you wont have a good experience here (remember cell phone provider service quality completely depends on where you live). Sprint offers good plans and decent (though not great) coverage, though they like to nickel and dime you any chance they get, (PCS vision package is requiered for picture sending, email and or web access). The quality of the sprint network varies, call quality is ussually very good, but dropped calls can be a bit of a problem, particularly while on the go. Also if you want to synch ur phone with your computer you'll need to buy a kit to do so, however this kit also supposedly will allow you to use your phone as a mobile modem for a laptop - very cool. All in all, I love this phone, and only have a handful of minor complaints or reservations about it. I havent seen a more complete, feature rich phone yet.",4
PCS Phone Sanyo SCP-8100 (Sprint),"I have owed the 8100 for about four months. - The main lcd screen: This screen is very bright. During a recent power outage, I used it to find my way around my house. - The call clarity: I used to make jokes about the poor reception I got with my Nokia 6185. With this phone, it sounds more like a land line than a cell phone. The first time my brother called my mom with the 8100, she could immediately tell that he had a new phone. The earpiece volume is adjustable, and can get very loud (almost sounds like a speakerphone). - The camera: Ok, so the image quality is low. But the features are impressive. You can assign images as caller id's for people in your phone book. You can email a picture to anyone immediately after taking it. I don't carry any family pictures with me. If I want to show pictures of my nephews and nieces, I can just pull out my phone. It even has a self-timer, so you can set your phone down and get in the picture. - The Calendar: I use this feature every day. You can set reminders (like: ""take out trash"") to repeat weekly, monthly, or annually. You can be alerted of events minutes or hours in advance. You can even assign a specific ringer as the alarm for an event. - Ringers: This phone supports polyphonic ringers, which are like normal ringers- except more ""vibrant."" It also supports "".QCP"" ringers (which are actual sound clips) containing songs or voice. You can assign different ringers for individuals in your phone book. - Games: The games aren't ""gameboy"" quality, but they do come close to those little pocket lcd games. Using the keys on the phone as controls feels a bit wierd. Some games use the phone's vibrator as a ""rumble"" feature. The selection of games available is adequate. - Applications: This phone supports some applications. I have installed and used a stop watch, an instant messaging app, the RealOne player (subscription service), and a to-do list app. I have yet to see any ""full-motion"" video displayed on this phone. - Email: After you sign up, Sprint gives you an email address that's attatched to your phone. You can send and receive text emails using that address (from your phone or their website). - Misinformation: When the documentation says it has ""screensavers,"" that's not true. What they mean is that the phone uses images kind of like the desktop wallpaper on your pc. When the phone is not in use, the screen turns off automatically. When the documentation says ""wireless internet,"" that is misleading. You can only view small html pages or specially designed ""wml"" or ""wap compatible"" pages. You can't view the amazon site the way it looks right now on your computer screen. - Ways to use it: This phone works even better when combined with some other services. >Textamerica provides free ""moblogs."" >Qualcomm ""Purevoice converter"" lets you turn your mp3 files into ringers. >Sites like 3GUpload let you upload images and ringers from your pc to your phone (for a small fee). >Wireless internet sites like Mapquest and Hollywood give you driving directions, movie times, and more using your phone's browser. This is a great phone. You'll have loads of fun with it, even if no one ever calls you.",4
PCS Phone Sanyo SCP-8100 (Sprint),"I love this phone. I've had my own for over a year now and have since bought one for my son and for my daughter. Battery life is excellent, more features that I could dream of using. The phone camera takes OK photos (don't even try at a concert... haha) - and the more modern phones do better in this department, but I'm very satisfied. Just be forewarned. With Sprint PCS, you will encounter many dropped calls and ignorant customer service staff. I've been with Sprint for 7 years now, so I know what I'm talking about. I'd switch, but we get a really good deal through our company. But I digress... the phone is great, I highly recommmend.",4
PCS Phone Sanyo SCP-8100 (Sprint),"The phone itself is a 5-star. The user interface is easy to use. The screen is bright. Battery prolongs several days on one charge. It receives better signal. The customer service is pretty bad, though. In fact, my wife is talking to their customer service when I write this review and it's been 2.5 hours on the phone and 1.5 hours in the SprintPCS store, let alone the time to get to the store. It was the technical support department that shed light on the issue which was customer service department's responsibility. Probably you want to call technical support department instead of customer service department when you have issues. Overall, a great phone with poor customer service.",4
Sony Ericsson T616 - Cellular phone - GSM - bar,"Like the others here, I've found AT&T to be somewhat bothersome. True, they have gotten better after the Cingular thing in terms of customer service, but I'm wary still. Despite their add campaign saying that the service is better, I still don't get any signal in my office. As for the phone, it's pretty cool. The display is pretty hard to see during the daylight, that can't be denied. I'm ok with that though. What I don't like is how, especially with the special ring tones, the phone will receive a call, light up, and then wait 5 seconds before it makes any noise or vibration. It's not a big deal if you're looking at your phone, but if it's in your pocket, it's already been ringing for 1 or 2 rings on the other person's side before you even know you've got a call. Also, it has flat out crashed on me a handful of times in the last 6 months of ownership. When I say crash, think of when computers crash - it won't do anything until I take the battery out to turn it off, but it back and then turn it back on. I've also had intermittent problems with buttons not working unless I press them at just the right angle and things like that. Last week though, the thing went completely dead. I couldn't turn it on, it didn't light up when it was on its charger, nothing worked. After a few days, it started working again. Maybe I have a loose connection somewhere, I don't know. AT&T sent a replacement overnight to me for a twenty five dollar processing fee - although they overnighted it to the wrong address (due to a really bad customer service person on the phone) and I got it 6 days later. Anyway, the Bluetooth is cool, it talks to my computer and transfers contacts and calendar items and pictures and all sorts of stuff. If I had it to do all over again, I'd probably get this phone again, but I'd think really long and hard about AT&T.",3
Sony Ericsson T616 - Cellular phone - GSM - bar,"I have no problem with the phone - actually I have been using the same phone (quite happy except for the less-than stellar battery and the easily-smudged body) before I lost it and had to replace it by ordering on Amazon, the beginning of my woes. I badly needed a replacement since I give out my number at work. I passed on the free-shipping and ordered 2-day expedited shipping - on day 3 I get an e-mail informing me that the items are delayed and will ship after two days. I am making other arrangements and lo behold the phone arrives - well, cannot complaint too much there :) As per instructions, I turn on the phone and wait for 45 minutes for the phone to be automatically activated (per instruction leaflet). After a frustating 2-hour wait nothing happens and I call AT&T. After taking down my entire life history I am told that the ""systems are down"" - a common support-insider-statement for 'moron it is our coffee break'. I am asked to call after 2 hours, which I do; the biography dictation again; this time I am politely told that since I bought it at amazon I need to call them. Ok, I call amazon. After the mandatory questions on order number, mother's maiden name, father's height - ""Oh, you want to activate a cell-phone. Well, our cell-phone dept closes at *4PM PST* - please call back tomorrow"". Tomorrow dawns, I call amazon - same questions, no answers - this time it is ""Oh, the AT&T systems are backed up. You could leave the phone on for a while (and between the lines ""hope for the best"") or I could submit your information and have the system activate your phone in 24 to 72 hours."" I chose the latter - I'm still waiting ...",3
Sony Ericsson T616 - Cellular phone - GSM - bar,"I've had this phone since November, and been very happy with it overall. For me, the main advantages of the phone are its very small size and the very hefty battery life. I feel like I really do get several hours of actual talk time before needing to charge. I've been happy with the quality, although that has a lot to do with the carrier, as well. The rings are generally loud enough to be heard under most circumstances, and the vibrate is strong enough that I can feel it even when I'm carrying the phone in a waist pouch. That said, I'll reiterate things such as you can't read the screen AT ALL in sunlight. And the UI design is a bit odd. It takes a lot of effort to do simple things like turn off the alarm clock before its gone off. You can't program any quick dial buttons which is annoying since I only call about three different people on a regular basis. And it does not go into lock mode if you leave one of the menus up (in fact, it leaves the screen fully powered indefinitely), or you get into M-mode (another feature you aren't allowed to de-program. I've NEVER used MMode, but I get charged a dollar or so a month from the times I've accidentally gone into it because the joystick moves that direction when the phone is in my pocket before it auto-locked.) The camera is not a good reason to get this phone. It's not useful for anything other than the fun factor, although I do enjoy being able to assign pictures to people when they call. If you can get this phone on a cheap we'll reimburse you for the cost of the phone if you sign up plan, go for it. For me battery life was one of the most important things, and I feel this phone shines in that department.",3
Sony Ericsson T616 - Cellular phone - GSM - bar,"I bought this phone for my wife (she wanted something small and cute) - she loves the phone and size. I decided to get a Nokia 6820 for PC syncing (with Outlook) capabilities. Pros: + size + bright, crisp screen + bluetooth + camera is not bad Cons: + Contact manager does NOT have addresses + phone ringer too low + syncing with PC using Sony Ericsson's software is a tough process - its a mess trying to make the phone be recognized by the software (at least for me it was and I a software engineer working in the IT field for over 7 years)",3
Nokia 3300,"I bought this phone and within the first couple of days, I wanted to return it! Pros: The features are nice, games loaded in memory and the radio/MP3 player, I love. The phone is small and portable. The keyboard is great if you are writing email or text messaging. Cons: The dialpad is too small to make phone calls (especially entering pin numbers for voice mail) practical. I'm use to using my thumb to dial; now I have to pull the phone away and use both hands (one to steady the phone and the other to push the right button). Don't think you can just enter your contacts in memory and you won't have to use the dial pad. You will if you have voicemail. I sold the phone and got the Nokia N-Gage!",2
Nokia 3300,I just saw that I bought this phone here in amazon. I enjoyed using this phone ages ago.,2
Nokia 3300,"I swapped out a Motorola MPx200 (which I fried) for a Nokia 3300 initially because of the low price compared to other phones with similar features. You do get a lot of ""bang for the buck"" with this phone. The selling point on the 3300 is the music player. It plays MP3 files and ""raw"" (not MPEG-4 encoded) AAC files. Because it does not support the MPEG-4 compression, you're better of with using MP3, as the raw AAC files at the same bitrate are acutally larger in size with no noticeable difference in quality. The music player is among the best I've listened to (it actually has some BASS output) with the provided stereo headset; you can also listen to it with the single-ear (mono) earpiece and the player knows the difference and switches from stereo to mono accordingly. You can also listen to either the music player or FM radio using the loudspeaker on the phone, but to listen to the FM radio you still have to keep the headset connected, as it utilizes the headset wire as an FM antenna. I have encountered an issue where the music player will arbitrarily change tracks, or the FM radio will spontaneously kick over to another station preset, but it could be from accidental keypresses on the case that I have the phone in. This phone also includes a recorder and a special audio cable (3.5mm standard plug on both ends) for connecting an external CD player or other equipment to record from to the MMC card (64MB) supplied with the phone. The phone records 64Kbps, 32KHz ""raw"" AAC format (64MB = about 2 hours of audio), which is fine if you are recording from the radio or voice but not the greatest if flawless quality is your preference from your CDs. The Nokia Audio Manager 3.1 software supplied with the phone is clunky and stalls frequently; I highly recommend using RealPlayer 10 with the Nokia Mobile Device plug-in (which also handles conversion to MP3 for you); RealOne Player with the plug-in is also included on the CD that comes with the phone. If you have a separate MMC reader, you can read the cards in that rather than in the phone to speed up transfers. The phone itself is a decent quality phone, as with most Nokia handsets. However, if you don't want to look like a space alien talking on it, you'll find yourself using the earpiece almost always (otherwise, you hold the narrow back side of the phone to your face to talk; which looks tacky and feels awkward). The full keyboard on the US ""B"" model is excellent for text messaging and e-mail--*IF* you have light to see it with (only the call, hang-up, and directional buttons light up, which means you can't see the numbers or keyboard in the dark--major issue if you have to communicate in less-than-ideal lighting; keep a little mini flashlight with you). The 3300 supports Java MIDP 1.0, which is wonderful. Most of the apps I used most frequently on my MPx200 I have found suitable Java alternatives for (MyCast Weather, Virca IRC client, EmailViewer e-mail client, and MapQuest Mobile for real-time directions are among some of the apps I use often). The built-in e-mail client is adequate, but forces you to download entire messages instead of just headers to see what you *really* want to read (downloading full messages can consume your GPRS bandwidth in a hurry if your e-mail box is big), so I use ReqWireless E-Mail viewer, which doesn't have that disadvantage. Like all Series 40 Nokias, the Calendar is very basic with limited capability, but the Contacts database is robust. Which brings up another major issue with this phone: lack of PC Suite support. The data cable supplied with the phone only interfaces with the MMC card in the phone and not with the phone's interface itself, so if you need to synchronize via cable or use your cell phone as a modem, you'll be SOL on this device. It only supports synchronization over-the-air using SyncML with a SyncML-compliant server (again, a bandwidth hog if your contacts/calendar db is huge); Nexthaus does make a SyncML server to sync with Outlook, but any calendar items not supported by the 3300 get skipped so your calendar is always incomplete (Contacts come through great though). Lastly, you would think that with this phone supporting the MMC card format that it would also support SecureDigital (SD). It does not, and MMC cards are becoming increasingly difficult to find as more vendors make the move to SD cards. The phone comes with a 64MB card, which is sufficient for most people, but if you like more than an hour's worth of MP3s, you'll want to look for a 128MB or 256MB MMC card. I will give it this much: there is a feature to backup and restore your phone's settings to/from the MMC card, which is a smart feature to use in case your phone should be accidentally reset. Overall, I do enjoy this phone, especially the awesome music player and the java support.",2
Nokia 3300,"Got mine in October '03. Loved the features. Great price with rebate. Pros: 1) Full keyboard - aids text input and beats a regular number pad hands down. 2) MP3 player - Can use MP3 files as ring tones, and just store songs on the memory card. Way cool. 3) Speaker - good for speaker phone and listening to music if headphones aren't handy. 4) Games - when you need to kill some time, the games are nice to have. 5) Internet access - decent net access, didn't use it much, though. 6) Menu - fairly intuitive and easy to use. 7) FM radio - another way to pass the time enjoyably. 8) Voice capture - good for making quick verbal notes. Cons: 1) Non-backlit keypad - impossible to use when dialing at night, especially combined with... 2) Small buttons - the dialing buttons should be larger. Easy to misdial, especially at night. 3) Center 4-way menu button - had to press it more than once to scroll down the menus. Must be a bad contact under the button. Extremely aggravating. 4) Poor speaker volume - even the shrillest ring tones don't penetrate a normal winter coat when I'm wearing it. Lost many calls that I never did with old phone. Hard to hear music with speaker through the normal din of all but the quietest areas. 5) Lost audio on calls - Often, a call would ring in, I would see who it was on caller-id, but when I picked it up, I couldn't hear the other person. Called back the other person, who said I could be heard fine. Only happened on incoming calls. 6) Poor earpiece design - the angle of the earpiece in the case makes it hard to position it flush against the ear opening. Poor volume means you have to cover the entire ear opening to get a clean sound. 7) Proprietary SD memory - If you take out the battery, you can pop out the 64mb memory card, but the unit won't take inexpensive standard SD cards, like a 256mb or 512mb card. Why? Nokia requires a special thin SD card only they are selling. Bah! Conclusion: It's a nice toy and can waste away your idle hours with blissful fun. You could run a mini cable from the headphone jack to a set of powered computer speakers and have a nice MP3 system. But doesn't cut it as a phone. I need a superior phone, and the rest is icing on the cake. Thought I could have both with the 3300. Nope. I'm getting a Motorola V300. It's an outstanding phone. Tiny. Features-a-plenty, and the rebates cover the entire phone and even pay me $51 when bought through Amazon and T-Mobile. Avoid AT&T Wireless! One month of calling on the 3300, no live customer service or email responses whatsoever. Shame on AT&T.",2
Samsung E105 Phone (T-Mobile),"I have had this phone for about 8 months now. I purchased it through amazon which was great and I've got all of my phones through amazon. The pros: Very nice screen Ringtones sound nice and clear external screen small size easy to use can store 1250 numbers including sim card Now the cons: The battery dies very quickly after about 2 hours of talking its completely dead and it doesnt give you a wanring it just shuts off It sometimes cuts off The screen is sometimes slow to move from screen to screen (mainly with games) no speakerphone no voice dialing This is a good phone, if I were to buy a new phone I would only say to try and find one with a long lasting battery because thats what Im tryin to do now.",3
Samsung E105 Phone (T-Mobile),"Previous to purchasing the e105 I was an s105 owner. I loved that phone but I had my pet peeves about it, the keys being connected on the keypad made it difficult to dial at times but as long as I wasn't driving this wasn't really an issue. Yes it was hard to see the screen in daylight but I don't expect to see a crystal clear picture on a cell phone, they aren't mini laptops folks. Although it was hard to read, it wasn't impossible. Unfortunately I went to a concert and lost that phone and replaced it with the e105. I have no complaints, I live in a basement apartment and the s105 wouldn't get service, but the e105 gets one bar and picks up all my calls crystal clear. I can hear the caller on the other line perfectly, my boyfriend has one as well and I can hear the whole conversation if I am sitting next to him in a room with mild background noise. I haven't had any problems with the screen going black, only when the phone goes idle but you can change that option from the menu. Overall I am pleased with this phone up to date, we'll see if it holds up.",3
Samsung E105 Phone (T-Mobile),"I've had this phone for 2 weeks now. I upgraded from Motorola V60 and I have to say that this phone is far superior. The reception quality is quite good and so far sound quality is good also. There are some great features to the phone such as the huge 64000 color display and polyphonic ringtones. It is small, (smaller then the v60) very light and sleek. The battery life however is mediocre. I usually have to recharge after about 2-3 days especially when writing text messages since the display is a power hog. The phone sometimes seems to be slow while going into menus from the main screen and there are no sound profiles other than the main one and silent mode. If you don't use predictive text writing then writing can a bit clumsy because of having to constantly switch from predictive mode which can not be disabled as the default. So far the phone is one of the best I have yet used and I highly recommend it. If the size, style and display quality are not that important to you then I would instead recommend the Nokia 6610. For me however, this phone is great!!!",3
Samsung E105 Phone (T-Mobile),"The title says it all. If you are looking for a small phone to use as a phone, then this Samsung will do you good. If you're looking for a smartphone/pda, you might want to look elsewhere. I've had my E105 for about a month and it has worked like a charm. My reception has been great (T-mobile) and battery life good. The flip phone design is sleek and saves on space. It's a pretty slim phone and will fit into any pocket. BUT the handset volume is low overall, so it should be avoided by those with hearing impairments. People seem to complain that you can't see the screen in direct sunlight, but for the most part all color screens have this same behavior. The outside display though is black and white and can be seen fine in the sunlight. As far as being a good PDA with PIM features, this phone lacks. But it does have a calendar with useful alarm features. It has infrared but no easy way to sync your phonebook with a PC without purchasing software.",3
Samsung E105 Phone (T-Mobile),Good phone if your in a pinch. Or your child has broken his smart phone and you want to teach him a lesson. 😉,3
Samsung E105 Phone (T-Mobile),"First of all, the Samsung phones are nice, but they ALL have a problem with the display not working after about one year. Just after the warrenty stops. I would suggest that if you are extra careful when you close your phone, it will probably prolong the life of the display. But I digress. I had the previous S105 model and the display went bad about 16 months after I purchased it. I had the 1000 minute T-Mobile plan for 9 months, and then I dropped down to the $10 cheaper plan for one month, and then went back to the 1000 minute plan for the past 6 months. When the phone went bad, I asked T-Mobile what they could do, and since the phone was out of warrenty, they offered a new phone which I did not like for $50 out of my pocket. I had the bright idea that I could order a new phone from Amazon for basically free, and have a replacement Samsung and still come out ahead. When I went to cancel the current contract, T-Mobile told me that I was still under contract for six months. When I switched back to the 1000 minute plan, it started my contract time all over again. They wanted to charge me $200 to terminate the contract. I spent 20 minutes complaining to the supervisor, and she offered to reduce the termination fee to $100, which I had to accept since I would be paying for two phones. Apparently, they consider the 1000 minutes to be a promotional plan, and they had the right in the small print to not give me credit for being a T-Mobile customer for the past 16 months on a 12 month contract. I have never had this problem with Sprint before and I was very upset that T-Mobile would treat their customers in this way. I have written a letter to their customer service asking for a refund, but I have had no response to my letter, which is also a major disappointment to me that they could not even acknowledge the they even received my letter. So if you purchase a T-Mobile phone, DON'T CHANGE YOUR SERVICE or else you will be responsible for a new 12 month contract the second you make the change. The phone is a great deal, and if you handle your phone carefully, and don't change your service, you will come out ahead. I fault T-Mobile for NEVER telling me when I made the change in service that a new contract would be starting, and they should be like other carriers that don't care if you change plans as long as you stay a customer. Shame on you T-Mobile!",3
Motorola i730 Phone (Nextel),"I have been using cell phones since before (the now defunt) AT&T Wireless was around, that was 1992 or so. I used an analog phone at the time and then switched to PrimeCo (before they became Verizon Wirless) and then SprintPCS. Up to that point I had no complaints about phones -- some had a better UI than others, but they pretty much did the same thing. I then switched to Voicestrea(before they became T-Mobile!) because I needed the international roaming feature, and they had the best rates on the market, and I could use the same handset, wereas with the CDMA providers I would have to pay for an additional service. This is were my cell-phone fun began. T-Mobile service was not bad at all, but I don't think that in the 2 or 3 years I was with them I was ever satisfied with my phone -- the volume was too low, the speakerphone was a joke, the phone was too big, reception was horrible, it kept on dying, etc, etc. I then switched to Nextel because I was tired of the billing errors involved with handsent replaments (out of warranty fees -- when the phone wasn't even 3 months old, re-stocking fees for phones I ""didnt return"" according to T-Mobile, etc, etc). I have been using this phone since late October or early November 2004 and I am glad to say I have had no major problems. The reception is great no matter where I go (I travel incredible distances in the state of Florida alone -- 15,000 miles since January, and that's just by car), the speaker and speakerphone are loud enough, and the phone is a decent size. In addition I can take the SIM card out of the i730 and place it in my GSM world phone for my trips to Europe, although the Nextel rates are a bit higher, they are about the same as what AT&T used to charge, and what Cingular charges today. Another great feature on this phone (and all the Nextel Java-enabled phones if I am not mistaken) is the navigation function provided by TeleNav. Not only can it tell me how to get to point B, it also has a business finder, based on my current location as determined by the GPS reciever that is built into the phone, but it even has a handy ""Gas by Price"" function, although it only can sort the listing by lowest prices on regular or 87 octane gas, which I cannot use in my vehicle, it will display the prices for premium or 93/91 octane gas as well.",4
Motorola i730 Phone (Nextel),"I've glanced at a few reviews and looked at the overall review for this phone, and think it's a little underrated. I've had a couple weeks to try out mine, and the battery life with my usage is 3-4 days, and I use the phone for short calls about 5 times a day. The phone doesn't squeak when squeezed, and all of the construction is tight (even the flip screen doesn't wiggle much). I saw a few complaints about the weight of the phone, and even a complaint about the metal battery panel. It's called quality, sometimes quality weighs a little, and if the phone makes your pants fall down when it's hooked onto your jeans, buy a belt. The phone employs java applications, so you can download programs to fit your needs from nextel, at a cost. You can also get them from third party sites, also ringtones, wallpaper, etc. The phone uses GPS, can locate your approximate position for free, with software it can give you directions from one location to another for free (navigational software), called telenav. The quality of the speakers and microphones on this phone is great. The speakers can be loud enough to hear in different rooms of the house, or quiet enough you can barely hear them. The sound is crisp, even on direct connect. Also, an answer to the slams against nextel itself, don't listen to it. The only problem is their tech support does not operate 24/7, other than that their customer service is as good as any service based organization I've ever worked with. This phone is full featured, it isn't exactly a PDA phone, but it's software capability and 65k color screen make it perform many of the same functions as a PDA. Great phone, if nextel services your area, you won't be disappointed.",4
Motorola i730 Phone (Nextel),"I recently moved to Phoenix, Arizona, and thought it a good time to get a new mobile phone. A friend recommended Nextel, saying we'd use the direct connect function. Cool. So I ordered an i730 from Amazon. After charging and activating and waiting the required day, I called to get my phone number. It was a Palo Alto, CA, number!? That's over 700 miles away! An 11 hour drive to the next state. No way close to a local number. Nextel did not seem to understand or care. ""It's the closest we have."" ""There are no 602 area code phone numbers left."" I begged for maybe a 480 number or anything that is a local call from here in Phoenix. Nothing doing. After a few more days and a few more calls to Nextel that went nowhere, I called Sprint (who have not been customer service stars to me in the past) and within four minutes had a local 602 Phoenix number working on my current Sprint phone. I canceled the Nextel service. They are charging me $35 (expected) plus $11.53 in taxes, fees and assessments ""we can't change"" for a couple of days when all I called was customer service. If you buy the phone, I hope Nextel has a local area code for you, because if they don't you are stuck for $46.53 and an Amazon return. It was a pretty color screen though . . .",4
Motorola i730 Phone (Nextel),well to be honest when I receive them I was very excited but then was very disappointed when I find out that the walkie talkie was no longer in use but overall I was happy.,4
Motorola i730 Phone (Nextel),Very nice,4
Motorola i730 Phone (Nextel),This is a great cell phone. Quality of the calls are great. Screen is easy to read. The phone features are easy to learn and remember. Only downfall is that the phone is hard on batteries. The screen chews up the batteries pretty quick making it a phone that has to be charged nightly.,4
Motorola i730 Phone (Nextel),Best phone at the time of purchase,4
Motorola i730 Phone (Nextel),"This is the only cell phone I've ever owned that I didn't have a major gripe. Excellent signal strength. Good looks. Nice display. Speaker phone. What else do you want? Some people want a cell phone to walk their dog and park their car, I just want the phone to ring and be able to hear the person at the other end, the i730 does that and more. Keep the charger handy though, the battery life is shorter than most. Of course with a car charger who cares...",4
LG L1400 GSM 850/1800/1900 Camera Cell Phone (Silver),"I've had this phone for about 2 weeks now. I bought it new and unlocked online through Amazon's Marketplace for about $235 (excl. s&h) but saw it on Ebay for $155 and I just thought, ""Ugh. I could've had such a better deal"". But anyway, before I bought the phone, as a ""gadget freak"", I've done a lot of reviews on it. Let's start with the phone's PROs and CONs. PROs: 1) I love the front design and colors of the phone. 2) The 176x220 display is absolutely beautiful! (unlike the Samsung E-105 phone that I had before). 3) The speakerphone is very clear, but I wish it could be somewhat louder. 4) The voice dialing option is quite useful, even though it tends not to work around noisy areas. 5) The camera's pretty good since you can't really expect a ""high-tech 2mp+ digicam"" out of a cell phone (maybe in a couple of years, but not now). 6) The mp3/polyphonic ringtones come out very true and not so ""muffled"" if you know what I mean. CONS: 1) The loudspeaker and speaker overall could be louder. 2) It would be so much nicer if the speaker isn't located in the back of the phone because once you put it down, the volume isn't as loud (that's why you should place it down on the front instead of on the back). 3) It would be nice to use the speakerphone whenever like for a example, when playing a voice recording. There are a lot of ""would'ves"" and ""could'ves"" and ""what ifs"" but you can't and shouldn't expect a phone to be perfect. If you were to compare the v400 with the v600, then there really isn't much of a difference besides the ""external blinking lights"" to tell you which group the person calling you is in. Big deal. It's just a flashy addition to the caller ID option - mainly to ""show off"". Also, the v600 and the v400 are about the same size - same for its memory capacity. If you're thinking about buying a V600 retail, then you're better off buying the v400 and saving the extra $100 for something else. Lastly, I'd recommend signing up with 3GUPLOAD.COM for ringtones and downloads. It's only $10 for unlimited downloads a year and you can always share the account with friends that have the same phone (or display resolution) as you! As for free downloads, you can try MY-JUJU.COM even though there isn't as much to choose from compared to 3GUPLOAD.COM.",3
LG L1400 GSM 850/1800/1900 Camera Cell Phone (Silver),"I've owned this phone for more than a year. It is bulky, slow-to-charge, prone to inadvertant changes in settings and finally, the keys are not easy to dial (number keys require very firm pressure, making one-hand dialing difficult). The sticky-key problem became so severe (no, it wasn't dropped in liquid) that I called Cingular while the phone was still in warranty. They sent another V400, which they claim was reconditioned. The replacement phone had no battery (you're supposed to keep the old one) and the face of the replacement was scratched and had clearly been abused. I kept the old phone and am switching service providers. Bad phone. bad service.",3
LG L1400 GSM 850/1800/1900 Camera Cell Phone (Silver),"I recommended this phone to my price-sensitive friends and family members, but chose to buy the V600 for myself because I wanted 4x zoom and web access. Both phones have this functionality. The V400 has a larger phonebook than the V600. The only benefit that the V600 provides is that it has Bluetooth functionality... if you need that feature. It is also a slightly more attractive phone. The V600 looks a bit too oblong. They are essentially the same shape, but the lines on the V600 create an illusion of clunkiness, whereas the the textured finish of the V400 is more refined... sort of like a Cadillac versus a BMW. Both have great reception and take great pictures. Both are easy to navigate. However, both are somewhat sluggish to respond when quickly scrolling through the phonebook. This effect is somewhat mitigated if you switch from ""icons"" to ""list"", but the sluggishness is a problem with the phone's memory/processor/software/whatever. Another complaint I have is that it doesn't have the full set of TAP Extended characters in the alphabet. For example, it doesn't contain Scandinavian letters such as ""A"" with a circle over it (""AA""), ""A"" with an umlaut (""AE""), or ""O"" with an umlaut (OE). It seems to have all the other TAP extended characters (eg: ""I"" with umlaut, ""U"" with umlaut, ""AE"", ""OE"", ""C"" with squiggly thing underneath, ""N"" with tilda, vowels with accents in both directions, ""Euro"" & ""Yen"" symbols, etc.). My only other complaint has to do with Cingular Wireless. Their voicemail system sucks! You are forced to enter your password EVERYTIME you call, even from your mobile handset. T-Mobile didn't require this. The transition from T-Mobile to Cingular was a snap by calling Cingular's Number Porting specialists (888-898-7685). However, until they get the voicemail thing figured out, I recommend you stay with your other carrier. T-Mobile and Cingular (at least until recently) share(d) mobile towers and coverage is identical. When AT&T's network comes onboard in October, the coverage area should increase.",3
LG L1400 GSM 850/1800/1900 Camera Cell Phone (Silver),"I purchased this phone last year sometime and have been using it since. I am not very pleased with the phone for numerous reasons. Let me break it down in list form. PROS: 1) Small, compact, light 2) Good LCD screen, bright, good colors 3) Pretty decent camera 4) Good layout of the buttons that are inside the phone (not the exterior side ones); easy to press CONS: 1) Side buttons get mashed inadvertently when stuck in your purse or pocket. This causes it to make a sound as it changes your settings. Very annoying to have to reset it back to what you had it to before 2) Intermittent freezing of phone. I'm not sure if it is the phone's operating system or if it is just a defective unit. Either way, it is annoying for me to have to open and close then try to power off and power on the phone to get it to respond again. 3) Slow response to buttons being pressed I am looking at other phones to buy to replace this one. If I were you, I'd look into other phones with similar options and features.",3

Nokia 3595 Phone (AT&T),Very nice!,4
Nokia 3595 Phone (AT&T),"I've owned my Nokia 3595 (through T-Mobile) for about 10 years and still love it. It is tough, easy to use, and the stand-by battery life still lasts about a week. Both reception and audio quality are excellent. I've long since stopped my monthly plan and pay $100 a year for 1000 minutes (and have never used them all). I'm a very light user, saving it for quick calls and emergencies, so I don't really need anything more. It feels great to save money and have a dependable phone on hand. Obviously it is not for everyone in this age of do-everything smartphones, but it suits my needs perfectly. I would also recommend it for parents who want to get their kids a nearly bullet-proof emergency phone, but want to save money and not ""distract"" their kids with internet access and tempting apps. As of this writing, it can be found unlocked starting at around $20. I'm considering picking up another one because my wife prefers my 3595 to her more modern touch screen Samsung. Nokia hit a home run when they made this model, and the ball is still in the air. UPDATE: 07/17/2015 - Mine finally started having issues recently where calls would go through, but I could not hear the person on the other end. It worked on and off. Removing the battery to reset for the closest tower didn't help. My wife and I ended up getting the iPhone6. A lot more $ but what a difference. The Nokia 3595 worked great for a long time though. A 10 year old cell phone!!! ~ Kort",4
Nokia 3595 Phone (AT&T),"I would like to preface my remarks with two points. First, about a year ago, I finally got a cellular telephone because of the kids and their schedules. One of us is having to take them places or pick them up a few times each week, and the traffic around here is arguably the worst on the planet, creating some interesting delays nearly every day. And I admit that sometimes I have to call home from the grocery store because there will be 23 different verities of BBQ sauce and my list just says ""BBQ sauce."" Second, my blood pressure soars when rude louts think they have the right to interrupt my lunch or dinner or infringe on my reading time in the doctor's waiting room to talk on their cell phones. I once saw a table of four people, each talking to an absent entity on his or her cell phone during an entire meal but not once talking with the real people beside or in front of them Now, that said, the Nokia 3595 is apparently the high-end of the low-end entry level phone. That suits me fine. This silver-gray mass of wires and circuits has enough features to me going for some time. I didn't know that cell phones had all these whistles and bells such as games, voice tags for contacts, alarm clocks, caller ID, and such. I like the fact that the contact list lets you have something like five numbers for up to 500 people. Five numbers per person---that's pretty crazy to me, the fact we have more phone numbers than we have people to use them! Why not run it up to eight numbers per contacts and bestow a full complement of eight phones to some octopi! The battery lasts for more than five hours of solid talking, but there is not a soul on earth I want to talk with for five hours straight. The sound is decent though I have a certain amount of trouble talking into space while trying to hold this plastic rectangle close to my ear. I feel like my jaw is floating up and away from my face. (I guess that is why folks like those flip phones but they cost more than an infrequent talker like me is willing to spend.) I was able to figure out most of the operating options, at least the ones I paid to get, without resulting to the manual, but I'm not sure if that is because the phone is intuitively designed or not. It may actually be because we are all moving toward some sort of collective consciousness that enables our species to share knowledge like those island monkeys that all started washing sweet potatoes once a certain percentage of their populations started washing the potatoes(In Transcendental Meditation, this phenomenon is termed the Maharishi Effect.) The various stock wallpapers with the phone are pretty boring and tend to make it hard to read the small display window. (I cannot fathom why folks would want to send photos back and forth to devices with such poor video resolution.) The manual that comes with this phone is OK, but the text designer could have done a much better job creating distinct, clear headings. I'm still sorting through some of the more humorous sections such as ""Your WAP browser,"" ""PUK codes,"" and ""Potentially explosive atmospheres."" (I cannot believe how many people are jawing away on a cell phone while pumping gas.) This little sucker is nearly as tough as a hockey puck, too. I've dropped my on the pavement at least half a dozen times and once had to snap it back together after what looked to be a fatal plummet. Well, it's scratched and scarred a bit, but it still works just fine. Well, I'm one of the masses now, no longer a cellular Luddite. If you see me walking down the street with a wire in my ear, gesturing wildly, and arguing with invisible beings, please help me!",4
Nokia 3595 Phone (AT&T),"I mean how can I complain... it was free with my service! Overall it is not a bad phone... it has plenty of options like text messaging and all that fun stuff... It has voice dialing (you know when you just say the name and it calls the person) if you feel like setting that up... A nice address book feature that allows you to store several numbers under one name and label them with cute icons like a house for home phone and a little cell for mobile phones etc... Sometimes it freezes up (kinda like computers) and you have to remove the battery to get it to work again!? What do you expect for free though? Major complaint: WHERE'S SNAKE??? I miss it! But there is a cute bowling game on it! It's a phone... it serves its purpose. It does not take pictures, but then again that's what cameras are for!",4

Nokia 3595 Phone (AT&T),"The Nokia 3595 is an ok phone but it has nothing more than the basics. It is a rather big phone so it wont easily fit in your pocket, but it a good performer when it comes to actually talking, it holds a signal well and hardly ever drops calls. The screen is color, but not a good color screen, it is washed out looking and dim.",4
PCS Vision Picture Phone Nokia PM-6225 (Sprint),Good!,3
PCS Vision Picture Phone Nokia PM-6225 (Sprint),I bought this phone for speakerphone and it was free (in 2004). The quality of speakerphone is satisfactory (definately better than sanyo) The battery life is very very low. It may be about one call of 40 minutes. It also doesn't give few minutes before one can notice that battery is draining because it draines within 5-8 mins once you notice 4 bars (max is 5 bars) Camera is totaly worthless as it has very blurry/grainy picture. The phone also works very slowly. In case if it's on eg. if you hit menu button by mistake it will stay on untill you exit after hours. There is no settings that can change this property and it ultimately drains batery even more quickly. And the same thing is bothersome as if you turn the alarm on but the phone turns on then the alarm will not work!!!!!! In short I would never buy a NOKIA again.,3
PCS Vision Picture Phone Nokia PM-6225 (Sprint),I like my little Nokia PM. When I went to buy it I just wanted the cheapest phone that was a little better than my LG I was using. I had my land phone cut off because people only call on my cell phone. I was going to get the plain Nokia but this one was on sale for just 10.00 more. My college age kid has the Sanyo 8200 and I won't lie her camera is fantastic because it zooms and has a flash but for an extra 10.00 I always have a camera handy and most of my pics have come out pretty decent. They always look better once they are on my PC. I haven't used the radio on the phone. I didn't get it for that purpose but I have the headset. Sprint's been decent to me and I got this in the Sprint store so for the price it is a good deal. Cell phones are just so expensive now due to all of the gadgets. This is a good basic phone. Don't expect expensive phone reception or expensive phone camera options when you are paying the bare minimum for a cell phone. I give it an A. It serves my purpose. Has my phone book in it and I don't lose calls like I did on my old LG phone.,3
PCS Vision Picture Phone Nokia PM-6225 (Sprint),"I've had this phone for about 3 weeks now, and have been pretty happy with it. My previous phone was a Motorola Timeport (Startac-style) flip-phone, which I was very happy with. As for the Nokia 6225... Pros: -good size...not too small -good reception -speakerphone works acceptably (for hands free operation when needed; people on the other end report a bit of static/echo, which is to be expected from a speakerphone on a device this small) -camera is a gratuitous but neat feature (be aware that Picture Mail will cost you extra if you intend to use the camera) -lots of features (calendar, voice recorder, speakerphone, camera, web, contacts, voice dial, FM radio [only with the special headphones which double as an antenna, though],etc) which might come in handy -no attenna jutting out from a corner Cons: -weak battery life...Two hours of talk time is Nokia optimism. Whereas I could go a few days with my old phone with normal use (a few calls per day), this one needs to be recharged every day or after a longish phone call (an hour) and it doesn't give much warning before shutting itself off. Consider getting an extra battery or the car charger or an extra charger for work, etc. -stupid ring tones. Why can't they provide simple ringers? You've got to go online to find them and then buy them if you want some normal ringers. (This is a minor gripe.) -While inactive (when not in use or after a little bit of inactivity [such as a long pause when loading a picture or typing a message]), the backlight on the screen turns off and the screen is virtually invisible. I'm not sure if this ""sleep"" time might be adjustable. -small keys with no space between them. I find that I press the keys with my fingernails because a fingertip might press multiple keys.",3
PCS Vision Picture Phone Nokia PM-6225 (Sprint),"I got the Nokia PM-6225 phone about a month ago and I have generally been very pleased with it. This phone is PCS Vision Enabled, which means it can take advantage of all the online features that Sprint offers for a 15 dollar fee per month. This includes downloading games, ringtones, applications, and screensavers which all cost extra money. It also includes web access, email, and text messaging. This phone also comes with a digital camera, though the resolution is poor as camera phones go. You can take pictures using the phone and send them in an email to anyone with a computer or a camera phone. The games look great on the 128x128 pixel display, though the keypad can feel a bit cramped. You can only access the web about 60 percent of the times you try, but this can be blamed on the Sprint service, not the phone and may be different in places other than New York. When you do gain access it runs pretty well and takes about 5 seconds to load each page which is good for a mobile phone. The reception is clear most of the time, and voices usually sound good though they can get staticky occassionally. The phone comes with a speakerphone feature that works pretty well although people on the other line have told me that my voice appears distant at times. The phone also gives you the ability to listen to FM radio, though this requires an extra 30 dollars to buy the antennae/headset. The reasons this phone did not receive five stars were: -Fairly low quality on digital pictures. -The power button is on the top of the phone and does not stick out so it is hard to turn the phone on/off. -You cannot gain access to the web a good portion of the time. -The keypad can feel cramped while playing games. -The screen can be hard to read in bright sunlight. Overall the Nokia PM-6225 is a great option for the Sprint customer who wants a cheap, PCS enabled camera phone, and I would recommend it. (The Nokia 6200 for ATandT is essentially the same phone without the camera feature.)",3
PCS Vision Picture Phone Sanyo PM-8200 Silver (Sprint),"because, after be waiting for the phone for 2 weeks the phone was broken when I got it. so please let me know if I can return the phone .",3
PCS Vision Picture Phone Sanyo PM-8200 Silver (Sprint),"The Sanyo PM-8200 is an awesome piece of equipment. Don't believe the hype! If you live in a major metropolitan area, Sprint service is often BETTER than that of other cariers. I live in the New York / New Jersey area and the service is great here, especially with a high quality phone like this one. I'm sure in some areas of the country Sprint may not be as good. I've never had a problem with my connection, although their customer support is another issue. That being said, this phone utilizes all the good things that Sprint offers. The wireless web through PCS Vision is great. The new link feature is nice too. It basically allows you to use this phone as a walkie talkie. Watch out Nextel! Contrary to some of the other reviewers, I actually like the speaker phone. I think the quality is good. How many cell phones actually have a speakerphone by the way! The camera is a nice feature. The PIM is cool too. It is true that there's not enough speed dial numbers for those who use that. I never used it too much with my Samsung phone anyway. What's worse is that my Samsung just was not durable. My experience with Sanyo phones is that they stand up to a lot of abuse! True, there are also not enough games and ring tones on this phone. Downloading that stuff sucks, not to mention that they want you to pay extra. It's a $300 phone, include some decent ring tones will you!!!!! Adding another criticism, why does Sprint go out of its way to sell phones that come with no accessories? This is an annoying problem, considering most of those cheapo plastic accessories cost them pennies to make overseas. Check out some of my reviews of the accessories for these phones. This is one problem that is not just about this phone, it's about the cell carriers trying to sqeeze their customers till they go broke. All in all, the positive far outweighs the minor issues with this phone. Every generation gets better, and the features on this particular phone make it more than worth the cash. This phone rocks, which is what I expect from Sanyo! Enjoy!",3
PCS Vision Picture Phone Sanyo PM-8200 Silver (Sprint),"I have had Sprint PCS service for just under 3 years, and in that time have switched phones 3 times. My previous two were Samsung phones -- the first was good, the second so bad that I had to consider getting another one just to get reception in my home. With the performance of that phone, I decided this time to try a Sanyo product. I had heard good things about the 8100, which this phone replaces, and was hoping the 8200 built on that reputation. After using this phone for almost 2 months, I have to say that I am very pleased. This phone has all of the features you can ask for, and yet with rebates and other offers is very affordable. Both color screens are very clear, and they display easy to use menus and a camera that takes pretty good pictures, considering the phone is not a stand-alone digital camera. The phone has a solid feel, and talk time is more than adequate, too (compared to my last phone, which may not be saying much). The nicest addition is the speakerphone, although the speaker could use a little clarity. Oftentimes, at low volume you cannot hear it, and when you put it higher, the sound is distored and reverberates. Since you can read about the remaining features above, I will point out a couple of disappointments, other than speakerphone quality. The first is the lack of screensavers, ring tones, and games. I know that since this phone is advanced, most people will end up downloading these things, but for someone that has little interest in PCS Vision or such services, this is a setback. Next, I am not sure why Sanyo only included 9 speed dial numbers -- my Samsungs allowed over 100, and it is limiting to have just those that are dialed by one touch of the keypad. My third complaint is not necessarily with this phone, but with the fact that even as good as it is, it does not mask the sometimes poor service Sprint PCS provides. It is either crystal clear or not there at all, and despite being told that this phone would give me much better reception (and it does compared to my last phone) it is still not near where some of the other carriers are. In summary, for the cost, you won't find a better Sprint PCS phone out there which includes all of the features you would expect from an advanced phone. And, when Sprint gets the service to where it should be, this will be a great phone to complement it.",3
PCS Vision Picture Phone Sanyo PM-8200 Silver (Sprint),"The last PCS cell phone I owned was the venerable SCP-8100 from Sanyo. It was a cute little phone that was the second cell phone from any U.S. carrier that could take pictures. (The first-ever model was the SCP-5300 also from Sanyo, released in July 2002.) The PM-8200 addressed two shortcoming of the 8100: 1) camera quality, and 2) speakerphone. The 8200 sports a higher-resolution built-in camera. Picture quality is also improved. The old 8100's pictures often had streaks and distorted colors. The 8200's pictures look much better. The speakerphone is definitely a great addition for those of us who like to multi-task yet dislike headsets. The volume and clarity could be a little better, but given the compact size of this phone, it's not bad. Reception on the 8200 is great, thanks to its external antenna. Battery life is good, unless you save a lot of things in memory, which depletes battery faster the more stuff it holds. The phone is attractive and can be customized in many ways, not to mention it comes in three colors. To Sanyo, I suggest you use the iPod Mini color scheme, because not many people like big red! In summary, the 8200 delivers lots of improvements over the already-excellent 8100. If you have Sprint or plan to get Sprint, this is the phone. If you want video recording, check out the Toshiba phone for Sprint.",3
PCS Vision Picture Phone Sanyo PM-8200 Blue (Sprint),"I ordered the Sanyo 8200 for a replacement of an LG phone that pretty much had worn out with use. The 8200 has some great features like integrated SMS and tri-mode. I also liked the color blue which was the reason I ordered it from Amazon as the Sprint stores only stock the silver. Without the phone activated, I played with the menus and made a few ""free"" calls to *711 to see how it worked. The menus have some cutesy bears as animation which I didn't care for although it would not surprise me if they could be turned off. Otherwise the two more serious issues were: 1) The lack of LED charge status indication. Every other cell phone I've ever had has some type of ""phone charged"" led so you know when it's ready to take out of the charger. 2) The voice quality compared to my old LG phone was clearly inferior on calls to Sprint customer service and vastly inferior to calls on my wife's new Samsung 1000. I did the comparisons on each ear hitting TALK at the same time. I like the LG phone and wish SprintPCS supported the new camera versions as Verizon does. Otherwise I'll get the Samsung and hope I don't pick up my wife's phone by accident.",3
PCS Vision Picture Phone Sanyo PM-8200 Blue (Sprint),"I purchased a PM8200 back in October 2004. I've dropped it, it's gotten wet, and it kept on working just fine, camera included, until late June of 2011 - the screen has gone out, but I can still make and receive calls. That's saying a lot for the durability of this phone. Now if I can find a phone that's as durable and as easy to use as the PM8200, I'd buy it without hesitation.",3
PCS Vision Picture Phone Sanyo PM-8200 Blue (Sprint),"Very Good and works well, will do business again",3
PCS Vision Picture Phone Sanyo PM-8200 Blue (Sprint),"First off, the color isn't blue, it's more of a cobalt, and I love the cobalt. The speaker on the outside is loud. I can actually hear this phone ringing as opposed to many other flip phones. The color LCD on the outside is just one of those extra things that you don't need, but is really awesome to see who is calling. The screen quality (for both screens) is amazing. Very sharp colors. The phone doesn't flip open and closed easily, it clicks... and that's good because it's not always falling open all the time and I'm not worried about it breaking the hinge. My only quarrels with the phone are that it is sort of confusing at first to navigate around and figure out all the settings (since there are so many) and you are not able to change the default soft keys for the main screen.",3
PCS Vision Picture Phone Sanyo PM-8200 Blue (Sprint),it would not work.,3
PCS Vision Picture Phone Sanyo PM-8200 Blue (Sprint),"I don't have the kind of money where I can buy a new phone whenever I get tired of my old one. I'm a college student and need a phone that is reliable and can be on all day. I actually paid less than expected for this phone after all of the rebates! The main reason that I got this phone was because everyone else had a Sanyo 8200. It was really the word of mouth and seeing the features demonstrated that made me get the phone. I'm very happy with my phone. I can have it on all day and use it when I need to. I'm home before the battery even tells me that it needs to be charged. The external color display is nice to have. I like having it over the LCD that my old cell had. I have more trouble with silencing this phone, though. When the display says that the sound for the ringer was off, the sound for the messages was still on. This can be annoying when you're in class. I found out that I needed to take the volume down one more notch to ""Silence All"" and the problem was solved. The signal for this phone is a lot stronger than previous cell phones that I've had. I still go into roaming on occasion, but I don't have the trouble with dropped called or the phone mysteriously shutting off. Another thing that I really liked about this phone, was that I am able to use the accessories that I had for my Samsung A500. I didn't have to go buy a new car charger or hands-free device. (Though this phone does have a speaker phone option, there are sometimes that the hands-free device is just better.) The camera is decent quality. I was able to take some pictures of a friend's wedding that I was able to share with her family and friends the next day. I also can take lots of pictures, upload them, then take more pictures. On high resolution, my phone holds about 20-25 pictures. Perhaps the best feature in terms of the construction of this cell phone is that the plastic is blue all the way through. If the outside of the phone gets scratched, you won't have a cream colors line. (This was a problem with a Samsung phone that I had. It had been scratched after 2 years of use, and the silver paint was coming off. I had flat gray plastic on the edges of my phone.) I went to an electronics store, and the wanted about thirty bucks more for the red or blue phones. However, if you get the phone from Amazon, there isn't a different in what you pay based on color! One improvement that I wish Sanyo would make is to have colorful hard plastic cases (kind of like the ones Nokie offered for the Nokia 5100 series phones). Other accessories would be nice, but I would just like to have something neat to protect my phone and to change it's personality a bit.",3
Palm Treo 600 Unlocked PDA Phone with SD/MMC--U.S. Version with Warranty (Silver),"Okay, this phone isn't perfect but it gets 5 stars. Why? Because at this moment its the best value for your money. Sure, the 650 is better, but unless you want to lock yourself into a 2 year contract its going to cost significantly more. Other comparable options cost similar to the 650. What I use it for: I'm a T-mobile customer and this phone is a) cheaper than the phone through T-mobile and b) is unlocked. So when I'm in Europe this spring I can simply replace the SIM and go. Note that this is the GSM model - it won't work on Verizon or Sprint. Pros: Syncing is effortless, scheduling software mimics Outlook 2003 perfectly. Phone works great - good reception and sound quality. Cons: No bluetooth, no WIFI (the 650 lacks this as well). Screen isn't hi res, camera quality is low (if you want quality get a digicam, I have a Canon S400). Lets be honest - this is yesterday's technology. Unknowns: Reliability. I've only had this phone for a few days, and we'll see how it stands the test of time. Conclusion: If you want the latest and greatest get the 650, Nokia 9300, or something else. But you'll be paying that early adopter premium. If you want something that elegantly does the job at a great price then get this.",3
Palm Treo 600 Unlocked PDA Phone with SD/MMC--U.S. Version with Warranty (Silver),"This phone is just what I was looking for: a way to combine my PDA with a good cell phone. It has all of the functionality of my palm device, plus the wireless phone and internet access. I really got tired of managing over 200 contacts on a cell phone - entering information using a phone dialing pad. Now I can enter contacts from my Outlook Contacts folder and hot-sync my phone with my laptop. Buying the phone unlocked enabled me to just pop in my existing SIM and use the phone with my provider (Cingular). Here are the reasons I didn't give this phone 5 Stars (you can judge how important they are to you): 1) Lack of bluetooth 2) Camera is ok at best - don't use it for graduation photos :-) 3) Low screen resolution (still good and usable, but res could be better) 4) Not graffiti enabled (although I purchased third party software [Jot] that works great). If items 1, 2, and 3 are a problem to you, then you might want to try the Treo 650, which costs a little more, but addresses those shortcomings. I am happy with the 600. It has been worth the money so far. ONE WARNING: If you purchase the unlocked phone, be careful downloading firmware updates from the PalmOne website. After performing an update, my phone locked and I couldn't use the phone with my Cingular SIM. Fortunately, I was able to get help from the seller and my phone is back to full functionality.",3

Palm Treo 600 Unlocked PDA Phone with SD/MMC--U.S. Version with Warranty (Silver),"I'm not sure what these last few negative reports are about! It's weird that they all come one right after the other. If I was a suspicious type...but I'm not. Maybe there was a bad manufacturing run, or some people just had real bad luck, but my experience has been excellent. As long as I'm on the subject of negative reviews - I've got tons of third party software loaded and this treo is more stable than the Windows XP desktop that I'm typing this review on. It does crash, but, very, very infrequently. In fact, this has been the best piece of electronic equipment I have ever owned. I've had it since the month it was released, and I'm still using it all day, every day, even up to now. I've used it with two different carriers - first Cingular and then T-Mobile. It has had excellent reception, (better than my wife's Nokia), from both carriers. And it is pretty rugged. I've dropped it: 5 or 6 times - on concrete at least twice. It's chipped up, but still works the same as the day I bought it. I bought a 1 gig SD Card, and I carry around a lot of music. So much that I never use my iPod anymore. I also joined [...]and I have room for one or two spoken-word books too. On the large internal memory I have eBooks, games, business applications, docs, spreadsheets, a video player, more games, and did I mention games? The phone and PIM functions are smoothly integrated and email is a breeze. My company gave me a RIM BlackBerry 7510 phone + email device. It is absolutly primitive compared to the Treo 600. The Treo's screen is super bright, easily visible even in bright sunlight. I love the fact that I have a keybord on the phone even if I don't use it all the time. I installed a thirdparty application that lets me write Graffiti style right on the touch sensitive display. The fact that it is a Palm device means it is as configurable as you want it to be. There are tens of thousands of software applications and upgrades available. So, in summary, in one pocket I carry a great phone, a fine chess partner, a calendar, my contact lists, a memo/note pad, an ebook-reader and half a dozen ebooks, an Audible player and a couple of audio books, an MP3 player and a bunch of songs, a fantasy role playing game, a backgammon game, poker and a solitaire card games, an MS Word doc reader, the ""Bejeweled"" game, a midi music sequencer, an email application, a world alarm clock/timer, a space conquest game, an investment calculator, and 10 or so more things (mostly games). I LOVE this phone. And it is unlocked, so I was able to change carriers with no hassel - if you've done this recently you will appreciate that this is no small thing. So, you may be wondering, ""is this guy just going to gush? Isn't there anything you don't like about the phone?"" Well yes, in fact, the camera sucks. It is better than nothing and I have had occasion to use it a few times, but it is low resolution, somewhat distorting and useless in anything but well lit situations. I'd still say it was the best, most useful piece of electronics I'd ever owned, even if there were no camera.",3
