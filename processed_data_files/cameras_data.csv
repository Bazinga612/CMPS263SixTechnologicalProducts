IPAflashcards: The International Phonetic Alphabet. Mastered.,"English teachers who work with native speakers of other languages will be thrilled with these flash cards. They are handsomely printed on durable stock with a protective coating for years of shuffling. I've been making my own for over twenty years, but the result has never approached the artful and clear design of these sturdy and compact cards. Students of linguistics should also find these cards useful for developing fluency in IPA transcription. The transcription of the example words for English is a nice compromise between overly broad and unnecessarily narrow. Diacritics, for example, are largely limited to markers of length and syllabicity. A General American accent is the model; primary and secondary stress are marked, as are syllable boundaries. For most ESOL/EFL teachers (at least in the US), the 43 cards covering all the sounds of American English will get the most use, and they are conveniently color-coded (Deck 2) to distinguish them from the rest. Linguistics students will likely spend more time with the other two decks, one with the symbol on one side and its phonetic description on the reverse, and the other giving the names for the individual symbols. The decision to separate into decks and package all three decks together was both generous and wise: for a slightly higher price, you have the capability to accurately describe the languages of any of your students, even if they hail from South Sudan! One might complain that a tool for teaching the sounds of a language should actually make those sounds audibly. (Perhaps the folks at Minokidowinan already have an app for the iPhone in the works!) But really, the task to which these flashcards are best suited is improving the fluency of phonetic transcription, which is, after all, necessarily a written exercise.",4
IPAflashcards: The International Phonetic Alphabet. Mastered.,"I'm starting my Masters in Teaching English as a Second Language so I wanted something to help me with studying the phonetic alphabet. These cards are ok, but I wish for the price they would have a little more information. They give you the mere basics you would expect from flash cards and do not give much more explanation. That would be fine if I wasn't paying almost 60$ for them. There are many complex terms on the cards that they do not explain at all. SO not a bad set, but I would have liked them to be a bit more in depth than they are. Other than that they are made well and have a good organization system.",4
IPAflashcards: The International Phonetic Alphabet. Mastered.,Excellent resource!,4
IPAflashcards: The International Phonetic Alphabet. Mastered.,Must have!,4
IPAflashcards: The International Phonetic Alphabet. Mastered.,I purchased these flash cards to get a head start on my Speech and hearing class in International Phonetic Alphabet study. These flash cards are perfect and I will get a lot of use out of them.,4
IPAflashcards: The International Phonetic Alphabet. Mastered.,"As one with a Bachelor's in Linguistics and much exposure to the world's languages, I have to say these flash cards are excellent. They are broken down into 3 different flash card types, each one helpful in its own way to mastering the phonetics of the world's languages. My only disclaimer would be that these cards do require some base-level prerequisite linguistic knowledge. For example, one set of the cards provides the IPA symbol on one side and the description of the sound on the other. If you are not familiar with basic phrases used in phonetics like ""central, back, closed, rounded,"" etc... you may have to do some research before using the cards, because there is not an in-depth explanation on the cards. It is this simplicity and organization of the cards that I actually greatly appreciate. Lastly, these cards may seem a little pricey... I will say that I think it is worth it. These cards are made to last and they are a great tool for learning, teaching, using with non-native speakers of a language, using for students learning other languages, etc. I would recommend these cards to anyone interested in linguistics, learning a new language, or teaching.",4
IPAflashcards: The International Phonetic Alphabet. Mastered.,"While I have a pretty limited knowledge of phonetics/linguistics as a formal discipline, I entered a drawing to win a set of these cards, because although I have rudimentary knowledge about the IPA, I have always been very interested in it. These cards make learning and understanding the international phonetic alphabet accessible, and not intimidating. The three different decks break down each symbol into three components- the phonetic description, transcriptions, and the symbol name. This breakdown allows you to focus on studying one component without being inundated with too much information, which is helpful if you've just been introduced to the IPA/ phonetics study, and allows you advance your study at your own rate. The cards are clear and concise, and laid out nicely! I've really been enjoying using and learning these cards!",4
David Busch's Canon EOS Rebel T3/1100D Guide to Digital SLR Photography (David Busch's Digital Photography Guides),When I bought my Canon EOS Rebel T3 I was overwhelmed with all the bells and whistles. I started in reading the manual and was really worried I wasn't getting clear enough information to use everything the camera offers. Then I bought David Busch's book and my worries were put to rest. Everything is explained in a clear way with lots of pictures to show you exactly what to do. This is a must have book if you own this camera and are just learning photography with DSLR cameras. It even has a companion book with the same name but in a spiral bound field guide. Buy it too and take it with you when you are away from your big book and need quick answers.,4
David Busch's Canon EOS Rebel T3/1100D Guide to Digital SLR Photography (David Busch's Digital Photography Guides),"This was bought as a Christmas gift to go along with the camera I gave my son. He seems to be well satisfied with it. The book is well written with lots of good information you can use. It came quickly, was in perfect condition, & no problems with the product or the seller.",4
David Busch's Canon EOS Rebel T3/1100D Guide to Digital SLR Photography (David Busch's Digital Photography Guides),"David Busch's Canon EOS Rebel T2i/550D Guide to Digital SLR Photography I got this book to help me learn about and use the features of the Canon T2i DSLR camera and have not been disappointed in it at all. I used to use a 35mm film camera until I switched to digital about 10 years ago and needed to refresh my memory on what and how to change aperture-shutter speed-iso, etc. to get good photos with this new camera. I was using basic point and shoot digital before this purchase. The book has been a great addition to the camera manual and the author expands and explains the settings so much better than the manual that came with the camera. The only criticism I might have is that I would like it to be spiral bound to lay flat. I am reading a section then laying the book down to try out the technique with my camera and the book always flops closed.",4
David Busch's Canon EOS Rebel T3/1100D Guide to Digital SLR Photography (David Busch's Digital Photography Guides),"If you're a complete beginner to the world of SLR photography, you should probably pick up a different book first to get a better understanding of aperture, ISO, focal length, etc. However, if you have a basic knowledge of photography, own a T3 and want to get the most out of it, this book is a must have. This book covers nearly every feature of the camera in great detail and offers good examples of when to use certain features, along with explanations and suggestions for making necessary compromises to achieve the results you want from any type of shot you're trying to capture.",4
David Busch's Canon EOS Rebel T3/1100D Guide to Digital SLR Photography (David Busch's Digital Photography Guides),"Book in one hand, camera in the other. This book has helped me explore the features of the T2i especially when I needed help through some of the menu options. Clear, concise explanations and photos and step-by-step work-throughs of the menu system. Plus some helpful general photography tips applicable to any camera. In short, this book has made my three year relationship with my T2i a pleasant and rewarding one. I since picked up a T3i but I still use the T2 for secondary shots with some of my other Canon lenses.",4
David Busch's Canon EOS Rebel T3/1100D Guide to Digital SLR Photography (David Busch's Digital Photography Guides),I bought and read this book after buying my first DSLR. It was essential in understanding how my camera worked and to understand how to apply techniques from Brian Peterson's field guide (my other favorite photography book). I still find myself going back and referencing this book if I get a new add on for the camera or don't quite understand how to achieve a certain technique. It's great and I always recommend it to people getting their first DSLR camera.,4
David Busch's Canon EOS Rebel T3/1100D Guide to Digital SLR Photography (David Busch's Digital Photography Guides),"By and large, David Busch's EOS Rebel T2i/550 Guide . . . is simply an upgrade of prior Canon Rebel books by the same author. This is not to say that it isn't excellent. Practice makes perfect. And this book is perfect for the beginner. And it is good for up-graders from lessor Rebel cameras to the T2i who want a review of earlier camera features that have been preserved. This might help some previous Rebel camera owners to better integrate all the new features of the T2i. The book has very little to say about video. Yes, all the video functions are covered. It's just that a great deal more than functions of the YT2i camera is covered in this book. Their is lens choice, flash, print editing, etc. Much of which is rehash of earlier books by the author. Again, I have no criticism of the usefulness and accuracy of this book. I just would have liked more video instruction. I guess video deserves at least one whole book of its own. After-all, David Busch's book already has 324 pages plus Glossary and Index. There isn't room for much more. While the book is very well written, and contains both accurate and extensive information on the T2i, I would think that long-time owners of cameras in the Rebel series simply do not need it. The instruction manual that comes with the camera should be enough. I write to give perspective to shoppers, not to sell the book, and not to detail what is in it. I hope this approach is beneficial. Please rate this review for usefulness. Helpful comments are also appreciated. Thanks.",4
David Busch's Canon EOS Rebel T3/1100D Guide to Digital SLR Photography (David Busch's Digital Photography Guides),"I am new to the Digital SLR world. This is my first camera I had bought, so the next best thing was to invest in the book to see how my camera works... Well I'm learning so much stuff, it's crazy!! This book is well written and easy to understand. There is a field book also, that I did not purchase at first, and I should have!! That will be my next purchase, that way if I forget something I have read, I can pull out my field book and have it handy!!!",4
David Busch's Nikon D5100 Guide to Digital SLR Photography (David Busch's Digital Photography Guides),"I am new to dslr photography and was looking for a book that would walk me through all of the functions on my new camera; not only how to use them, but when and why I want to. I started reading ""Understanding ""Exposure"" to learn some of the basics about photography and then turned to this book to show me how to apply those techniques to my own camera. This book is great, really easy to follow and very thorough. I really appreciate how the author structured the walk through from basic to advanced techniques, and the extra info about lenses and software. This is a great guide to help you get familiar with the d5100, don't be intimidated by the size! Highly recommend.",4
David Busch's Nikon D5100 Guide to Digital SLR Photography (David Busch's Digital Photography Guides),great!!,4
David Busch's Nikon D5100 Guide to Digital SLR Photography (David Busch's Digital Photography Guides),"Well written for both beginners and more advanced. Its really quite interesting. Now, if the pictures would just take themselves, i would be all set! I highly recommend this book if you're going to spend the money on an expensive camera.",4
David Busch's Nikon D5100 Guide to Digital SLR Photography (David Busch's Digital Photography Guides),Received it on time and as advertised,4
David Busch's Nikon D5100 Guide to Digital SLR Photography (David Busch's Digital Photography Guides),Covers the topic well,4
David Busch's Nikon D5100 Guide to Digital SLR Photography (David Busch's Digital Photography Guides),"I recently purchased the Nikon D5100 and read the owners manual as diligently as I could, trying to figure out how to fully use all of the possible options this camera has to offer. It becomes quite apparent that the Owners Manual simply isn't enough. I ordered this book and it arrived a couple of weeks ago, and it really opened my eyes as to what this camera is capable of. Everything is set out in sensible chapters, shows and explains every mode available, and gives you a sense of empowerment over the camera, instead of bewilderment. If you are upgrading from a basic DSLR or taking a huge jump to this camera as a first DSLR, then this book is a must. Without it, or something like it, then realizing the full potential of this camera could take a very long time, and be very frustrating. With my camera body I bought a very good lens. I'm delighted I also bought this very good book.",4
David Busch's Nikon D5100 Guide to Digital SLR Photography (David Busch's Digital Photography Guides),This book is another of my must have's for learning my D5100 Camera. I have a few books and this is one of my favorites. Its helping me to become a better photographer.,4
David Busch's Nikon D5100 Guide to Digital SLR Photography (David Busch's Digital Photography Guides),"Busch writes lots of books on DSLR's and Advanced Point and Shoots. His book on the Nikon P7100 is magnificent. This book exceeds that and is incredible. Very useful, it is not a rehash of the Nikon Manual and is aimed from the beginner to the professional and tells you about the features: what they are, why you should use them, or not: There is a high level of personal excitement excuded in this Book.",4
Dinosaur National Monument (National Geographic Trails Illustrated Map),"Excellent map; should be the ""go-to"" place for information on getting around Dinosaur. It showed trails I did not know about previously, and have added to my ""bucket list"". Watch the weather closely when you travel in/around Dinosaur. Many trails can become impassible during and after a rain event. Things often dry out quickly, but you could be stranded for a bit until they do dry out.",4
Dinosaur National Monument (National Geographic Trails Illustrated Map),"Very good map, on time.",4
Dinosaur National Monument (National Geographic Trails Illustrated Map),Got this map so that I can take my daughter camping. It is a good map but lacks some desired detail - like names of dirt roads and trailheads.,4
Dinosaur National Monument (National Geographic Trails Illustrated Map),"This is an essential map for driving around the monument, camping at developed sites, and taking the day hikes on the quarry road. Beware that some of the trails are wishful thinking. Some existing trails are not on the map. Ask at the visitor centers. Better still, ask several people at the visitor centers because the staff may not know the real answer. Be self-reliant.",4
Everglades National Park (National Geographic Trails Illustrated Map),"It is better than the NPS park map but when it comes to navigating a place like Nine Mile Pond, trust your GPS and carry a compass. It has the numbers totally inaccurate and that could cause some serious problems. They claim it is up to date, but it is not! The thing that annoys me about the folks who publish this map and field guides is they get it vetted by some knuckle head who poses as an authority but is clueless. It never occurs to them to try to use their product or watch their target market use them. So, the product is mediocre and they could care less. At one time National Geographic stood for some level of integrity but that seems to be a thing of the past.",3
Everglades National Park (National Geographic Trails Illustrated Map),Used this map planning a kayak camping trip with my daughters. It came in handy while at home planning. It has great detail and can be used in conjunction with your GPS for complicated trips. Glad I bought it. This is not a pocket guide type of map. You need space to open it up.,3
Everglades National Park (National Geographic Trails Illustrated Map),After taking this map on a trip to the everglades I will warn all: do not rely on this map for navigation. It is not up to date and it is very basic. It is fine for the basic layout of things. But do not use on the water trails for canoeing/kayaking. Get a NOAA map. We took both and if all we had to rely on was this map we'd still be there.,3
Everglades National Park (National Geographic Trails Illustrated Map),"This is a huge map with very good scale to see details. You'll be flipping it back and forth to see where an area is continued, but that's the price of having so much on one double sided map.",3
Everglades National Park (National Geographic Trails Illustrated Map),Can wait for this trip.,3
Everglades National Park (National Geographic Trails Illustrated Map),Very useful during our vacation trip to the Everglades.,3
Everglades National Park (National Geographic Trails Illustrated Map),"Great map, kind of old. I didn't notice any discrepancies but it's not very comfortable using a map this many years old. Check it and reprint!",3
Everglades National Park (National Geographic Trails Illustrated Map),"Fast shipping, good product.",3
Mount Baker and Boulder River Wilderness Areas [Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest] (National Geographic Trails Illustrated Map),Great map to have if you like to explore the Mt Baker-Snoqualmie NF. We have four of these maps that cover the entire area from the central Cascades all the way to Canada. These maps have kept us from getting lost in the maze that is the forest roads throughout the Cascade Mountains.,4
Mount Baker and Boulder River Wilderness Areas [Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest] (National Geographic Trails Illustrated Map),"Probably the best recreation map available, but like all othe maps of the area, not completely up to date (e.g. the Baker Lake Resort was closed a couple of years ago). As good as this map is, it is still a good idea to check with the Ranger Station in Sedro Woolley for road conditions, campgrounds, etc.",4
Mount Baker and Boulder River Wilderness Areas [Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest] (National Geographic Trails Illustrated Map),"Great map if you want to hike near the Seattle / Everett cities, but this one is missing distance markers on the trails. Some NG maps have them, so it would be nice to see the consistency from the this great publisher.",4
Mount Baker and Boulder River Wilderness Areas [Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest] (National Geographic Trails Illustrated Map),"Nice, very detailed map. Exceeded expectations. I sent this map to a friend who's into Orienteering and he loves it.",4
Mount Baker and Boulder River Wilderness Areas [Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest] (National Geographic Trails Illustrated Map),Happy to have a durable hard copy of local trails for hiking.,4
Mount Baker and Boulder River Wilderness Areas [Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest] (National Geographic Trails Illustrated Map),"best maps! they can be refolded, twisted, wrinkled, drenched, sat on, driven on, and they still look great!",4
Mount Baker and Boulder River Wilderness Areas [Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest] (National Geographic Trails Illustrated Map),"Not much to say. It's a map, it's good map. Very detailed, well made, perfect for the backpack. No complaints.",4
Mount Baker and Boulder River Wilderness Areas [Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest] (National Geographic Trails Illustrated Map),Awesome,4
Nikon D200 inBrief Laminated Reference Card,"If you are not an academic photographer who reads the manual studiously,and then obediently practises what you have read to reinforce what you have learnt, then these cards are the way to go, because it's when you are out there actually taking photos that you need prompts. These cards are light and portable, so they don't contribute more bulk and weight to your camera bag. I used them with my D70s and will continue to do so with any new SLR I acquire. There is a similar product which is not as convenient to carry but which is also helpful so I use both. After spending thousands of dollars on equipment, the cost of these is small change.",4
Nikon D200 inBrief Laminated Reference Card,Perfect for the field when you need that answer,4
Nikon D200 inBrief Laminated Reference Card,"Pro level digital cameras have extensive menus and controls. Functions and controls not frequently used can be difficult to remember how to access. This Reference Card is easy to carry and provides enough information to find a menu or button without the user's manual. The card's quality, design, and graphics warrant four stars but I have not used it enough to give it a five star rating.",4
Nikon D200 inBrief Laminated Reference Card,The picture makes it look larger than it really is. It does fit in the camera bag when folded. Serves as a quick reference well.,4
Nikon D200 inBrief Laminated Reference Card,Very useful tool . . . .,4
Nikon D200 inBrief Laminated Reference Card,Good to have.,4
Nikon D200 inBrief Laminated Reference Card,"Pros: It is laminated and has a lot of quick information Cons: The print is small but I understand that, with all the information on it. My problem with it is that it is 11.5 X 8.5 inches that is folded into thirds which makes it 3.75 X 8.5. A little big for the pocket. If it folded in half to make it 3.75 X 4.25 it would fit better in the pocket. I woul recommend the ""Blue Crane"" ""inBrief"" reference guide.",4
Nikon D200 inBrief Laminated Reference Card,Handy guide.,4
Nikon D300 inBrief Laminated Reference Card,"Unless you have a photographic memory (no pun intended) and can remember every option and setting on the complicated D300, a small ""cheat sheet"" is an absolute necessity when traveling. It has saved me from some stupid mistakes (wrong focus or metering settings), and most of all it provides a quick reference when you want to utilize one of the more esoteric functions of the camera. If you can remember all the options more power to you; for me, the small price (and small size) of this reference guide is invaluable. It beats ending up with lousy photos.",4
Nikon D300 inBrief Laminated Reference Card,THIS GUIDE WILL SERVE ME WELL ON POINTERS ON MY BRAND NEW NIKON D300 WHEN I GO ON MY CRUISE VACATION..........THE FEATURES OF THE D300 ARE SO NUMEROUS.........THAT THIS IS A WONDERFUL ITEM TO HAVE AS A QUICK REFERENCE POINT.........WHEN I WILL BE OUT AND ABOUT SHOOTING.... THE GUIDE IS COLORFUL....AND PRINTED TO BE READ EASELY..I RECCOMMEND THIS ITEM TO ALL NEW AND CURRENT NIKON D300 OWNERS....,4
Nikon D300 inBrief Laminated Reference Card,"This little fold out is not a bad item to have in your camera case for new D300 camera owners. I can't say I've ever used mine on a shoot, but it's there just in case. Good quality construction, color-coded subject organization, it should last fairly well through normal lite usage. If you need to refer to this all the time, you should really take the time to learn your camera. I highly recommend David Busch's Nikon D300 Guide to Digital SLR Photography for that purpose. ;-{>",4
Nikon D300 inBrief Laminated Reference Card,"YOU WANT THIS. After you've read the Nikon book (if you can actually get through it), and after you've read whatever manual or Field Guide you purchase in addition -- Magic Lantern, Thomas, whoever, you'll want to have this with you. It fits in your pocket, it fits in your camera bag, it fits in your vest. It lets you know where every function is on the menus and on the camera. YOU CAN'T REMEMBER ALL THIS and you can't carry the Field Guides out in the field. Come on People, its not that pricey. You spent thousands on your camera and lenses -- this thing helps.",4
Nikon D300 inBrief Laminated Reference Card,Excellent!,4
Nikon D300 inBrief Laminated Reference Card,Excellent,4
Nikon D300 inBrief Laminated Reference Card,"Lots of info in a small space. Color coding makes specific details easy to find, very intuitive. You dont want to carry a manual around but this probably has the answers to 99% of you questions espically if you are just a casual user.",4
Nikon D300 inBrief Laminated Reference Card,Very handy and useful. Fits in Camera bag well.,4
Nikon D90 Inbrief Laminated Reference Card,"If you are a professional photographer or a well seasoned amateur, then you more than likely will not need this card. I am neither and I find it comes in handy quite often, ISince it is plastic laminated I can carry in my camera bag and get it out in any kind of weather. I already had the D-80 camera and ""cheat sheet"" thus when I got my D-90 I just naturally purchased the same sheet.There are actually 12 sections that covers very briefly the operation of the D-90. This includes a Custom Setting section, Flash photography,white balance,exposure,metering, bracketing,Control panel and Playback. Even if you only seldom use this guide you will find the cost to be minimal for the information listed. By the way, all of the info on the card is also contained in your user manual, however why carry that manual with you everywhere you go? This is well worth the small price paid.",4
Nikon D90 Inbrief Laminated Reference Card,When I received this reference I was so busy that I didn`t open it right away. When I did open it I realized that the writing was so small that I could barely read it. This is not what I expected.,4
Nikon D90 Inbrief Laminated Reference Card,"While this reference card doesn't contain all info essential to the camera, it has the basics covered very well. The card is high quality, laminated and is very handy for those shoots on the go. The card stows away very nicely. I would recommend this card to any D90 owner, especially for novice to intermediate photographers. I'm an experienced shutterbug, but new to digital photography and this card has come in handy several times. Many tidbits of info are stored on this card and the layout is simple to understand. A very brilliant idea for the architect of this product. Sure beats carrying around a book or manual when traveling light!",4
