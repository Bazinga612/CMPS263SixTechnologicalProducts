"Apple iBook Laptop (500-MHz PowerPC G3, 64 MB RAM, 10 GB hard drive)",I purchased this item advertised as Used which is fine with me as I'm on a budget. The price is deal breaker. Beware though I just got it whole shipping was reasonable time the product Piece of junk. In comments Now the want to tell me it's only for parts doesn't even work plus no charger. So here I have this useless old laptop and negativa pockets Merry Christmas to me. Do not buy ANYTHING.... I only took the time to post this to prevent someone else's LoSS.,2
"Apple iBook Laptop (500-MHz PowerPC G3, 64 MB RAM, 10 GB hard drive)",when I receive the computer the screen is all scratched up bad! I will be returning it for another one or a refund! it was ranked almost 4 stars and given a 95 Percent,2
"Apple iBook Laptop (500-MHz PowerPC G3, 64 MB RAM, 10 GB hard drive)","Originally the Apple iBook Laptop that I received was not the requested 600-MHz PowerPC G3, 128 MB RAM, 20 GB hard drive. When the seller was made aware of this, they immediately sent me not just the originally requested laptop, but an upgraded 800mhz/256mb RAM/30gb HDD model, as well as a partial refund! Thanks to exceptional service by this seller, I now have an excellent computer.",2
"Apple iBook Laptop (500-MHz PowerPC G3, 64 MB RAM, 10 GB hard drive)",Very pleased with this purchase. It was a gift for my boyfriend and it works beautifully. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a dependable computer at a cheap price.,2
"Apple iBook Laptop (500-MHz PowerPC G3, 64 MB RAM, 10 GB hard drive)",Computer has never worked. Screen is black only. Price was cheap so I guess you get what you pay for!,2
"Apple iBook Laptop (500-MHz PowerPC G3, 64 MB RAM, 10 GB hard drive)","I really do not like the product that I got. It is not willing to connect to the internet, i've tried numerous ways. The screen does not want to turn on unless its in a certain position which makes it impossible to type and read at the same time. I am really disappointed in this product.",2
"Apple iBook Laptop (500-MHz PowerPC G3, 64 MB RAM, 10 GB hard drive)",This laptop held up great during shipping. No damage at all. I received it quickly as well. It's been holding up great so far. It's perfect for what I use it for.,2

"Dell Latitude CP M233XT Notebook (233-MHz Pentium MMX, 64 MB RAM, 4.1 GB hard drive)","I purchased this refurbished notebook computer from [another store] just last week. In a matter of days, the package arrived at my door. The product has many extras I didn't expect: a PC modem in a double PC slot, a handsome Dell carrying case, a Dell manual installed on the computer, and others. ... It turned out to be a great buy for the money for me.",5
"Sony VAIO PCG-FXA47 Notebook (1-GHz Athlon, 256 MB RAM, 20 GB hard drive)","I bought it thinking that Sony was a good brand, but they clearly have no clue when it comes to making computers. The first problem is the battery life. At first, it could last 20 minutes of websurfing, but now it doesn't last five minutes of sitting still with nothing going on. It immediately powers down without shutting down of hibernating. The second problem is the default hard drive configuration. Basically, they split it up which causes more problems since so many programs install to the C: drive by default anyway, plus Windows XP is bloated and takes up the majority of the space anyway, then PC-Cillin tries to take up a lot of space too and you've almost lost all of your C: drive space from these two programs alone. The third problem is the graphics card. It's integrated with the normal memory and has horrible performance. While I don't expect to be playing the latest games on this machine, it's not even capable of playing games that are ten years old with a decent speed. The fourth problem that I have is the LCD itself. It's not very bright, and with any sunlight at all it's unreadable. Other than those, it's a pretty standard machine. I managed to avoid some of the software problems others have by uninstalling one of the hotfixes of XP and upgrading the mouse drivers.",2
"Sony VAIO PCG-FXA47 Notebook (1-GHz Athlon, 256 MB RAM, 20 GB hard drive)","If your are looking for a good used laptop..........look elsehwere. The FXA47 is loaded with software and problems and VERY POOR customer support. In the 2 years we have had it, it has stayed in the case most of the time because of lockups. I have restored it several times to original configurations with no help. Sony is clueless and wants to charge for phone supoport and has only responded to 1 of my e-mails. It seems that everytime we install software the computer wants to lock up. My Compaq 2715US works great with out any problems. I will never by another Sony product.",2
"Sony VAIO PCG-FXA47 Notebook (1-GHz Athlon, 256 MB RAM, 20 GB hard drive)","The Sony VAIO PCG-FXA47 offers a great combination of features, rubber-to-the-road performance and affordability for the home user who wants the freedom of a laptop. The DVD/CD-RW drive drew me in, and the fast processor and generous memory sold me. The 20GB hard drive should be plenty for almost everyone (documents/photos/Quicken), although a user editing digital movies might have to think twice. This laptop comes with 10/100 NIC, so DSL connectivity is a snap. The software shipped with mine was also very useful. Note that it comes with serial & parallel ports as well as 2 USB ports, so connection to your peripherals is also convenient. The price is very good considering all you get. All in all, a good deal!",2
"Sony VAIO PCG-FXA47 Notebook (1-GHz Athlon, 256 MB RAM, 20 GB hard drive)","I've been mostly ok with this laptop until recently, but there are a few problems that I must mention: 1) The battery life is horrible. When you unplug it, it may tell you that it's going to last two hours, but even new, the battery only lasts about 20 minutes of just websurfing (if you are watching a DVD or anything like that, you'll be lucky to get much more than 5 minutes from the battery.) 2) It gets too hot. I've found that different programs cause it to heat differently. I tried running Seti@Home on this laptop, but that caused my lap to almost get burned. You have to be very careful with that. Also, the rubber feet on the bottom of the laptop have come off because the heat of the CPU melts the glue on the bottom. This has made a mess of the various tables I've put it on, as well as some pants when I've used it on my lap. 3) The sleep functions don't work right. Every other laptop I've used has had a function to make the laptop shut down or go to sleep automatically when the battery gets too low. This laptop doesn't appear to have this. When it feels like it, it will just shut down with no warning. This has happened at random times when I don't have it plugged into the power. 4) The drivers stink. There are various problems related to Windows hotfixes and some of the specific hardware drivers. I forget which one but there was a hotfix for XP that conflicted with the mousepad driver and caused the laptop to freeze up. As far as I know, Sony never fixed the driver so I've left the patch off. I doubt I'll ever buy a Sony laptop again, but it's not the worst I've used. I'll probably buy an IBM Thinkpad next time, because they are the best laptops you can buy.",2

"Apple iBook Laptop 12.1"" M8758LL/A (800-MHz PowerPC G3, 128 MB RAM, 30 GB Hard Drive, CD-ROM Drive)","This is my first ever Apple notebook computer and I must say I am terribly pleased. At first I was worried about not having a G4 processor in it, but after recieving my G3 800 iBook and running osX and a few games I must say, I can barely ever discern a difference between this and my imac G4. I ordered 256mb of ram with my iBook because this speeds it up significantly. You probably wouldnt notice many differences until you try to run more than one application at a time, then you start to feel a little sluggish. This computer is great, I was worried that maybe it was one of the crappy logic board ibooks but nope, the serial number is far newer than the ones that are at risk for bad logic Boards. And finally the look of the ibook is seriously cool. I can't wait to go to borders and study for awhile. While everyone else has the same colored gateway laptops plugged into the wall power that borders provides I can cruise with my trusty awesome looking ibook on battery. Also, the power adapter is small, and the thing about people saying the keyboard feels like plastic I disagree with, it is kinda ... hmm, hard to explain, but definitely a plus in my book. Im used to the hard cruching key boards and this one is much less crunchy. Also, the 12 inch size is simply the best size for a laptop. Anythin bigger and portability almost seems like a hassle rather than a joy. Awesome computer. Dont forget to pick up that extra 256 mb of ram to get it up to 384mb making it much smoother.. actually, completely smooth... Heaven on earth lol.",4
"Apple iBook Laptop 12.1"" M8758LL/A (800-MHz PowerPC G3, 128 MB RAM, 30 GB Hard Drive, CD-ROM Drive)","First thing I should mention: I bought this laptop at a spectacular sale price. I paid $729 for this machine with 640mb of RAM (maxed out) and an Airport card with it. I highly recommend that you do max it out. I played with the 128mb version of this in Compusa and I noticed it to be significantly slower. When maxed out, this machine will run significantly faster than my 1.67Ghz Windows XP desktop in any task you will throw at it. On top of that, the Mac OS is far superior to anything ever put out by Microsoft. It's stable, easy to use, it just works. I have OS X Panther on this and I highly recommend it. I could never live without Expose, Apples far superior answer to the PC bar at the bottom. For those who are not familiar with it, this new feature in Panther will allow you to push F9 on the keyboard and show every window that is open. It will show exactly what is happening in that window at the moment, meaning that if I were to have a video running on it, the video would play on the tiny window as I look for the window I want. I click the window and it goes back to normal, only with that window on top. VERY USEFUL. Besides that, this machine is very well designed. The ports are on the side, no more reaching behind to plug it in. Its got a thick layer of plastic casing, yet is just over an inch thick. The 12 inch screen is amoung the clearest I've ever seen, and is suprisingly easy to use. The speakers are just okay, but you don't buy a laptop for speakers anyway. The snow colored design is absolutly beautiful, and is a nice plus. The screen is on a solid bar, not one of those flimsy PC hinges. This is the most solidly built, yet lightest, thinnest, most compact laptops I've ever owned or used. I have had several PC laptops before this one, and this is, by far, the best machine I have ever owned. By the way, the battery life on this machine is, to sum it up in one word, unbelievable. I can get about 4 hours of battery life while watching VIDEOS on this, surfing the web I can get upwards of four and a half or more! The low power consumption of the G3 processor makes this an ultra-portable machine. For those who are considering switching. Don't be discouraged by the OS right away. It is something you will need to get used to, but after a few days you will never know how you ever lived without it. I now go back to my PC and just absolutly despise it every second I use it. I have now gotten used to the Mac and enjoy it more than I ever did with my PC. You know what they say, once you've gone Mac, you don't ever go back. Well, to sum it up, this machine is perfect. I have yet to come across any sort of flaw whatsoever. Mac has thought this thing through, their attention to detail is amazing. Everything down to the little hook that comes out just as you close the lid to lock it shut has been designed perfectly. This isn't something that has just been scrapped together by Dell or something, this is a powerful piece of computing genius that has been designed for people out to make the intelligent choice for their computing needs. If you're stupid, go the ways of the PC world and conform to the ways of Bill Gates If you're smart, buy a Mac, you won't regret it. I guarantee!",4
"Toshiba Satellite A15-S127 Laptop (2.0-GHz Celeron, 256 MB RAM, 30 GB Hard Drive, DVD/CD-RW Drive)","I am trying to connect this to my wifi,it doesn't work,it seems like its not wifi ready..Anybody here know how to connect this to my wifi?",4
"Toshiba Satellite A15-S127 Laptop (2.0-GHz Celeron, 256 MB RAM, 30 GB Hard Drive, DVD/CD-RW Drive)","I have two other laptops, a Panasonic ToughBook for work and a Dell Latitude. I immediately noticed the Toshiba Satellite has a solid feel and is comfortable to use, much more so than the Dell. I have not noticed any problem with the touchpad as mentioned by other reviewers. There is plenty of space for your hands to rest on the keyboard, and I noticed my hands do not tire as easily. The keyboard is well laid out. It is virtually silent, unless the fan is briefly running. I did find that the unit gets quite warm, but I use it on a lap desk. The 15"" screen is very bright and clear; the resolution is great! The sound through headphones is very good. I am used to having two card slots, so having one, was different, but hey, I only use one card at a time anyway, for my wireless. Two USB slots are enough for me and I consider the combo DVD-RW drive a plus. All in all, this is turning out to be a stupendous buy, made more so by the fact that I paid less than $500.00 brand new, after (the dreaded) rebates. In my opinion, to get something this wonderful for this price is certainly worth the rebate hassle!",4
"Toshiba Satellite A15-S127 Laptop (2.0-GHz Celeron, 256 MB RAM, 30 GB Hard Drive, DVD/CD-RW Drive)","As an owner of a Toshiba S127 and this S157, I can tell you that this thing is pure quality. Dell's laptops have gotten almost pitiful in quality, while IBM are insanely priced. Where's the quality, inexpensive laptops? Toshiba is your answer. Trust me guys. Get this model. I bought the S127 and ended up giving it to my mom. This model comes with the built in wireless Internet (which is awesome), 40GB of storage, 512MB DDR (XP uses MUCH more than 256MB even doing the simplest tasks), and 2.2Ghz Celeron (you can't tell the difference between 2Ghz & 2.2 Ghz,trust me). I scored my S157 in brand new condition for $825 off some really nice guy off eBay I struck a deal with. (I picked it up locally) I'm going to review every single thing about this laptop, sequentally. Please note that this is an unbiased review: 1.) Keyboard: Probably the best keyboard i've ever used in over 18 years of computers. I loved these soft key laptop keyboard. Doesn't have that annoying cursor thing in the middle of the keyboard that some people like to use. (Most despise it, though) 2.) TouchPaD: Works great. Two basic buttons, silver color, and work perfectly. 3.) 15"" XGA screen. The screen is nice, bright, and vivid, but I definately could use SXGA (1280x....) XGA is only 1024x768 and is just enough for basic tasks 4.) Speakers: Silver titinium stereo speakers. They work adequately for basic needs. What can I say? They're laptop speakers. Go pickup some Logitech Z-340s for $30 at Best Buy. They will compliment these nicely. 5.) Design: Design is superb. The laptop is suprisingly thin (1 inch) and the colors are perfect. Really great job. 6.) Weight: 6.15 lbs, according to my measurements. 7.) LEDs: The LEDs are great. 5 basic small LEDs that tell you what's going on. Nothing fancy. 8.) 802.11b Wireless (S157 only). This is great. You can save your PCCard slot; you can also disable/enable the device whenever you want. Someone mentioned somewhere that the built-in wireless card means it uses the notebook as an antenna. I don't believe that though. 9.) CD-RW/DVD ROM: Works perfectly. I would've perferred a trayless drive (like the Pioneer 16x DVD drives) but hell, this is great. They both work great. 8.) Battery Life: Battery life is not as good as I would like it to be. I get 2 1/2 hours max out of this computer on a full battery charge, assuming light working conditions. Extra battery costs $150+tax at Best Buy or Circuit City. I'm using my mother's S127 batter. ;) 9.) Noise Level: Both computers are dead silent. There is a fan that turns on once in a while to cool the computers. The fan isn't loud at all. 10.) PC Card Slot: It only has 1 PC Card slot, but that's not an issue anymore now that I have built in wireless internet 11.) Ports: Serial: Great but I don't use it. Parallel: Ok, I still don't use it. 2x USB 2.0: Now, this is beautiful. I have several USB devices, some even USB 2.0, that I use with this computer. Neither models come with S-Video, DESPITE what some specifications say. The model also comes with external VGA for connecting to a projector or external monitor. RJ45 (Ethernet) AND Modem already installed. What a great value. 12.) Performance: Hard drive: Works decently. Only 4200 RPM, so don't expect mind-blistering performance, but it's fast enough even for an end user. Processor: 2.2Ghz Celeron is like a crippled P4; nevertheless, it performs almost all basic functions with ease. Gamers apply elsewhere. Sound: No comments. Sound works. :) Video: This is my biggest complaint (besides the microphone) about this model. Comes with 32MB Intel Extreme Graphics (Shared). Because it's shared with system memory, people tend to think it's 64MB Intel graphics; believe me, it's NOT. It's 32MB Intel extreme graphics that will let you do only the basic video or gaming. Don't expect any kind of performance from this. I really wish Toshiba had put an ATi Radeon mobility in here, but for the price I'm not complaining. :-) * Software: I don't use the software that comes with this bundle, but make sure to check the personal cons below for additional details. * Toshiba Utilities: As with most utilities, I don't like running manufacturer's utility files, but Toshiba's aren't _that_ bad. (I still don't run them, though). They allow you to control most of the function buttons at the topic and assign them different functions. Build Quality: This is where the laptop truly shines. Putting IBM's insanely high quality and price tag, this is the best laptop you can get for budget-price quality. Toshiba rules. Personal Cons: * No built in Microphone. The thing has a port for a microphone, but I really, really wish Toshiba had put one in. I know this isn't an issue for most people, but I use microphones on a daily basis. They're cheap, granted, but that's another thing to lug around. * Rebates: Ugh, I hate rebates. I got my S127 for $760 (after 8.5% tax) and after $250 rebates. I got my S157 for $825 cash from some guy on eBay. * One thing that annoys me is that Toshiba has loaded this comp with plenty of useless junk like AOL, Special offers, etc. This is an easy fix. I just wiped the drive and put XP Professional on there and boom, it's done. :) The S157, IIRC, comes with Microsoft Works, which I don't use. If you want more detailed pictures of this laptop, search on [...] They have both models and detailed pictures on it. I hope I haven't missed anything. :)",4
"Toshiba Satellite A15-S127 Laptop (2.0-GHz Celeron, 256 MB RAM, 30 GB Hard Drive, DVD/CD-RW Drive)","Confession: I got this laptop for an absurdly low price after rebates, so that might influence how happy I am with this laptop. I am the not-so-proud owner of not one, but two HP laptops that were great for a year each and then they died. On one, the backlight went out, and the other the motherboard and/or CPU went on the fritz. Nice. So, being in law school, I needed a laptop, and happily this one was on super sale! I love the 15"" screen, though I would prefer higher resolution. The touchpad, as you probably have read IS a bit jumpy, oddly enough--not sure why, but hey, there you go; I probably just need to adjust the sensitivity settings. I'd like integrated wireless standard, but wireless cards are pretty cheap these days. And the hard drive could be bigger. That's all I'd change though. I don't play games on computers much anymore--no time, and if I do, I'll just play on a console. So the Celeron works fine for what I do: research on the internet, and write papers. I haven't had ANY problems whatsoever in over a month, but check back in a year and let's see how it goes!",4
"Toshiba Satellite A15-S127 Laptop (2.0-GHz Celeron, 256 MB RAM, 30 GB Hard Drive, DVD/CD-RW Drive)","This Toshiba laptop is built very nice with superb features. 15"" screen is very good for watching DVD or computing work, resolution is great. 30GB hard disk is enough for most people considering that it has a CD-RW built-in. All the usual connectivity features like USB 2.0, ethernet, modemare built in. You can add a 802.11b WiFi card is wireless option is needed. RAM can be upgraded easily if need be, one slot is empty for expansion. 256MB is ok for Win XP, future OS versions might need 512MB. 2GHz Celeron is more than enough for 99% of people. The battery life is adequate and weight is a very reasonable 6 lbs for 15"" screen laptop. Keyboard is very good and touchpad is excellent once you get used to it. It will get hot since it uses a desktop Celeron and there will be some fan noise. Get a Centrino/Pentium-M based laptop if you want cooler, more portable and smaller laptop. But it might cost you twice the money. Much better built than a Dell or HP. Dell has too many tricks on their website to get a decent price for similar configuration. HP uses third party chipsets on their low end laptops. Athlon laptops are also equipped with poor quality SiS chipsets. The chipset used in this is Intel 852GM with 32MB shared video memory. Intel chipsets are solid and stable. All in all a superb laptop for students, home users and small business use. Perfect PC replacement with easy portability. Toshiba rocks!",4
"Toshiba Satellite P25-S607 17"" Media Center Laptop (2.80-GHz Pentium 4 (Hyper-Threading), 512 MB RAM, 60 GB Hard Drive)","Hello. I love this machine, You should know that the TV receiver can only be used without the battery, (the module goes in that bay) so you MUST be plugged to an outlet. Also needs an external antennae conection (includes conector) The Remote Control for the media center is quite nice BUT you need to attach an IR receiver (also included) to one of your USB ports so this is not that practical after all... Great buy, but I just wanted you to know what I did not when I ordered... :) Awesome screen, very useful.",4
"Toshiba Satellite P25-S607 17"" Media Center Laptop (2.80-GHz Pentium 4 (Hyper-Threading), 512 MB RAM, 60 GB Hard Drive)","I have not generally been kind to Toshibas, but I must say I took a liking to this one the first time I booted it up. It is impressive to look at, quite high-tech with great lines and lots of cool colored lights. But it's what's inside that counts. It has a very, very fast 2.8 GHz CPU with an ample 512 megabytes of 800 MHz FSB RAM (expandable to 2 gigs), a 64 megabyte dedicated vidcard and a 17"" display that is unbeatable. The 60 gigabyte hard drive, though, is a bit smaller than I would have expected. That it has a digital TV tuner, can play and record DVDs as well as CDs (so it can be used as a true media center instead of just as a PC) and that it features a full function remote control are all just that much more ""lagniappe"" (oh, that's a cajun word for 'that little bit extra' you didn't expect but were pleased to get). Anyway, why only 4 stars? Well, mainly because this computer is not really a laptop, unless you have a very, very big lap. This is a desktop masquerading as a laptop, and believe me, at a whopping 10 pounds it isn't going to be making very many trips. That may all be fine and dandy, but there is a significant penalty for it being called a laptop, namely a higher price than an equivalent desktop media center (look at the Gateways, for instance) would command. For most folks, this is overkill. Where would it be perfect? I would say it would be true Nirvana in some lucky person's dorm room, though it would also look most handsome under anyone's Christmas tree!",4
"Toshiba Satellite P25-S607 17"" Media Center Laptop (2.80-GHz Pentium 4 (Hyper-Threading), 512 MB RAM, 60 GB Hard Drive)","I purchased a P25-(s)607 about a month ago and have been nothing but pleased with its performance. Pros- a. HUGE screen that really allows you to see a lot at one time b. really fast computer. Benchmarks were outstanding for this product when I ran them right out of the box. They did nothng but improve after I did all the recommended steps (esp. driver upgrades) c. Lots of goodies that no other laptop has... 4 USB 2.0 ports are great, and the DVD R/RW is really fast (4x) by today's standards. The 5400 rpm hd is fast, though with 60GB isn't the biggest out on the market these days (though with a dvd rw you really can't mind too much) Cons- a. This puppy is BIG... and heavy. Even though the screen is a whopping 17 inches, there is an area around the screen of unused plastic (about a 1-1.5 inch edge) This only adds to the huge footprint of this laptop. b. The keyboard is relatively big, but is still not quite full size. In fact, the keyboard on my 15 inch compaq laptop is actually wider by almost 3/4 of an inch. It is still a capable keyboard though. It is also placed in about the center of the huge case, which can make using it a bit uncomfortable. c. Lights, Lights, Lights... boy, this thing has a lot of pretty blue and green lights... and I can't find any way to turn them off. This can be a bit distracting while watching a movie in the dark. d. Battery/TV tuner issues. there is only one battery port, and if you want to use a secondary drive (or the included tv tuner for that matter) you have to remove the battery. I know it seems semi-logical as you will be plugged into a cable anyway for the tv, but at the same time, you would think toshiba would find a way to incorperate a battery. e. price- lets face it... this isn't the cheapest laptop on the planet... though it is one of the fastest and best equipped All in all, I would probably rate this as a 4.5 star computer. I haven't fallen in love with it yet, but the courtship is well on its way. L.",4
"Toshiba Satellite P25-S607 17"" Media Center Laptop (2.80-GHz Pentium 4 (Hyper-Threading), 512 MB RAM, 60 GB Hard Drive)","I waited a long time for a windows laptop to get a 17"" screen, and this model made it worth the wait. This machine is huge! It weighs almost 10 lbs, and dwarfs my old 15"" machine. If you plan on taking trips with this, think again. The screen is very crisp, and gives you the room to place two windows side by side. So far, everything seems very fast, probably due to the faster hard drive and the extra video memory. But, I would have liked to have seen a 7200 rpm drive instead of the 5400 rpm one. One thing I will say is that the machine looks much better than the pictures indicate. This machine has just about everything you need in a desktop replacement. Surpisingly, it runs very cool with a 2.8 GHz processor. There are 3 fans on the bottom and a huge heat sink in the back. I would have liked to see a separate keypad since Toshiba had the room to put one in, but the overall feel of the full-size keyboard is good. The small tab key, though, is tough to get used to. Another major annoyance is the touchpad. It will select items with a slight touch, and I have not found out how to turn it off. I have called tech support 3 times on this to no avail. Toshiba's tech support has not impressed me on this issue, and I have had trouble understanding the tech support staff. ***Update*** Tech support has told me that this machine does not support the features most touch pads have, like being able to turn off the tap to click feature. However, I believe it just needs a different driver. *** I have also had trouble with the supplied TV Tuner. The machine will not boot with it installed, nor will it allow me to connect to the TV. Tech support's solutions so far are to re-install all of the drivers, which did not work. This has not been resolved yet. Having said this, I am very impressed with the product, and would highly recommend it. But I think some of the lower models may be a better value.

"IBM ThinkPad R40 Laptop (1.8 GHz Pentium 4-M, 256 MB RAM, 20GB Hard Drive, DVD/CD-RW Drive)","Sorry to break the news to the previous reviewer (please -- you really have to use a product more than one day to give a competent review), but there is nothing cheap about this laptop. Perhaps he had it configured with a little less power, but mine works as well as any laptop I've ever used. This is my second laptop, but the first one was a small 486 I bought because the size was cool. Now, THAT one was cheap. IBM has made the best laptops and have the best service. The only question for me was initially, whether I wanted to pay for it, and then, which one do I get. Mine is configured with a 2 gig chip, a 40 gig HD, and 512 Meg of RAM. Please don't skimp on the RAM or you will wonder whether your system is slow. It came complete with Windows XP (which I don't care for) and I had to reconfigure everything so it looks more like Windows 2000, which I have on my other desktops. I use the laptop for surfing on wireless internet connections -- both home and away, writing letters and other documents, doing some financial spreadsheets, and will soon be doing some film editing work. The trackhead (whatever its called) works MUCH better for me than the simple trackpad. But the pad is there, and you don't have to use the eraser shaped head in the middle of the keyboard if you don't want to. I don't remember hitting the head and moving the mouse when I typed the letters ""h"" and ""g"" (or whatever two keys it is between) so if you don't like it, it should never interfere with your work. The screen is great! Big enough to have your desktop arranged like you like and plenty big to watch DVDs. The CD/DVD tray comes out, and feels somewhat flimsy, but you shouldn't have a problem taking care of it. On the left side are the various inputs, including (at least on mine) USB, firewire, and s-video. For you multimedia types who want a PowerBook for creative tasks but need a PC to do real work on, don't worry -- the Thinkpad has what you need. I considered a PowerBook and might have actually bought one (even though I'm firmly grounded in the Windows camp), but the prices were just way too much, and I would need a boatload of additional software for the Mac. While your emotional side might miss a PB (Apple does have a knack for appealing to the emotion), the logical beast in you will realize the TP has what you need. The unit will, like every other high powered laptop, get hot on bottom. Mine doesn't create much of a problem. When I'm using it on my recliner, I put a pillow under it and I am fine. When using it on a table or desk, there is no issue. Battery life on every portable unit is always disappointing. I've had my TP since March and have used it some, but not a great deal (once or twice a week on average, but lately increasing). I'm at a little more than three hours, and there is an indicator that clearly gives you an idea how much time you have left. If you fly cross country or longer than 3 hours and need all that time to work, you will need multiple batteries. Finally, I haven't noticed any pixel loss on my screen. The unit is solid enough to take most anywhere. While I treat all my equipment well and don't dropkick anything, if you are a bit rougher on your stuff than I am, I don't think you will need to worry. But don't take this review for any advice on how the IBM will work if mistreated.",3
"IBM ThinkPad R40 Laptop (1.8 GHz Pentium 4-M, 256 MB RAM, 20GB Hard Drive, DVD/CD-RW Drive)","Bought this for my college sister, broke in weeks. I had previously given it a good review, but at the time I hadn't gotten the feedback on it's functionality. Do not recommend.",3
"IBM ThinkPad R40 Laptop (1.8 GHz Pentium 4-M, 256 MB RAM, 20GB Hard Drive, DVD/CD-RW Drive)","... did not really review Model 2681CU1 as shown on this website. This models comes with Pentium 4 -Mobile 1.8 Ghz, 256MB Ram, 20GB Harddrive, CD-RW/DVD-ROM drive. Like the first reviewer said, the 20GB drive should really be called 16GB drive, and in reality, because IBM reserves about 4GB to store recovery info, leaving you with about 10-11GB of hard disk space you can use, so if you really need a lot of hard disk space, beware that instead of 18.6GB, you'll only be getting about 10GB. Boot up on my machine takes about 1 minute with PC cillin Antivirus running, (booting to Win XP Home) so if you are used to 20 sec bootups, this machine will be slow to you on a bootup. However, once all of the programs are loaded, the computer performs pretty fast. Also, please note that the Hardrive is about 4200 RPM, so replacing the Disk for a higher RPM's will shorten the boot up time. IBM does not provide a lot of software, I believe I only had Norton AV 2003, PC Doctor and Adobe (among others). You can type the Model number in IBM's website and get the exact detailed specs of what exactly comes (and does not come) with this laptop. What I like is that the Norton AV and all other applications do NOT load automatically. You have to go to START--> Programs --->Norton AV 2003 and it will start installing Norton AV 2003. My previous laptop had all of the software already preloaded, which made it a little more painful, because you ended up uninstalling a bunch of useless programs you did not need. The laptop's case is relatively sturdy and appears like it can take the ocasional bruising without major impact. Also, the BIOS on this laptops comes configured to MAX BATTERY mode, which means that if you are booting from the battery (i.e the AC adapter is not plugged in) your CPU Speed Step will keep the CPU cycles to 1.2Ghz maximum even if your power options says ""Always ON"". Setting the power setting to AUTOMATIC (in BIOS) will fix this. BEFORE YOU ADJUST BIOS, call IBM tech support to make minimize your chance for errors. I was impressed with the quality of IBM tech support. I 'd say that I got a live person within 2 minutes and the tech support was somewhere in the US, as opposed to overseas. Battery life seems to be close to 2.5-3hrs, though I have not had a chance to test it out fully. When fully charges, the battery indicator says that 3 hours is left. Beware that this laptop does not come with a floppy drive. I think that the reason this Laptop costs $1100 is that there are Pentium M chips that are out, replacing P4M's. Oh, and last thing, I have IBM T23 at work and found that the ultrabay drives used with T23 are compatible with R40's (all except R40e) drives. Check IBM's website for verification. ...",3
"IBM ThinkPad R40 Laptop (1.8 GHz Pentium 4-M, 256 MB RAM, 20GB Hard Drive, DVD/CD-RW Drive)",I can honestly say that this thing is built like a rock! This laptop is now closing in on being ten years old. I noticed most of the reviews were old. Well here I am with it ten years later and it still runs like a champ.

I will be purchasing more ram for this laptop. The Hard drive has a specs of 20 gigs. I think it might be from the way IBM had set this up its starts out at 15.6 gigs on the hard drive and only leaving you with 10 gigs free on it. You will def need a external hard drive with this unit. There is no software so i suggest you down load open source or if you got copies of office you can use it. One of the best features is it has a long battery life. But if you got the extra cash i suggest you buy HP, Sony or somthing better. if you need the extra power.",3

"Apple PowerBook Laptop 17"" M9110LL/A (1.33-GHz PowerPC G4, 512 MB RAM, 80 GB Hard Drive, DVD-R/CD-RW Drive)","This aluminum-shelled gem marries beauty and brawn so well that that owners of lesser laptops will surely have a hard time hiding their envy. It's fast and capacious and, like other Apple products, a joy just to take out of the box and see how Apple has thought about every step of the user experience, from unpacking to setting up the built-in wireless networking (a total breeze, and I'm a klutz at that kind of thing). In that same vein, there's the G4 Powerbook's keyboard that automatically lights up with a soft glow from underneath the keys as the light in your office or your airplane cabin dims. It's a small thing, but indicative of a genuinely respectful, design-centric, user-oriented mindset that no other computer company can match. The display is lovely to behold and s-h-a-r-p, and the wealth of (count 'em) 1.3 million pixels makes it hard to go back to my 15'' flatpanel iMac desktop screen. Watching a DVD on a Powerbook screen this big and this good is about as satisfying as visiting my local cineplex, sans the sticky floors. Like the new G5 desktops, the G4 Powerbooks strike me as quite hi-tech and futuristic. That's not a bad thing, but it's a far cry from the happy candy-colored iBooks of a few years ago. The G4 Powerbooks are also not as ""warm & inviting"" as the current generation of elegant white Powerbooks. The persona of the G4 machines is a bit more stand-offish, stark even, and you either like that or you don't. I think they're plenty gorgeous but, at the risk of sounding sexist, my hunch is that it's a 'guy' computer, and that a lot of women won't take a shine to these machines. But I'll let Apple's marketing department worry about that. Finding Panther (Mac OS 10.3) loaded on this machine was a greater boon than I'd imagined. I've used 10.2 (Jaguar) since it came out in August 2002, but Panther is such a big step forward, it almost qualifies as a whole new operating system -- without the learning curve. You can log out without quitting open applications, for instance, in a matter of literally seconds. The improved Finder -- which appears to be modeled in part on Windows XP, though no Mac user would admit that without the benefit of thumbscrews ;-) -- makes navigating through complex hierarchies of folders and files a snap, and it's easy to customize. Also, Apple has brought back color labeling of files and other items -- an OS9 staple it stupidly discarded when the company launched OSX a few years ago. There are more than 150 other big and small improvement (wait'll you get a load of a feature called Exposé, which displays all your open windows, across applications, at the roll of a mouse!), but this is supposed to be a review about the computer, not its operating system. Well then, the G4 17'' Powerbook is a tactile and esthetic pleasure to use. The fit is tight, the finish beautiful. Everything just works right out of the box without the user having to study manuals or spending time on the phone with tech support. I would gush about this machine (and so far I have!), but there are a few minor points of criticism, too: - Apple does sometimes put good looks over practicality. The shell of this Powerbook has no ridges on it -- it's just this sleek, smooth expanse of aluminum. Very purty, but since this is a large and relatively heavy laptop, you're quite likely to let it slip from your grasp at one point or another. Some kind of grip would have been a good idea. Also, there's a latch at the front of the machine that you push to unlock the screen. The latch is almost perfectly flush with the front of the case (so as not to visually break the sleek line of the shell, I'd wager), and I find that it sometimes takes two or three pushes before the screen pops open. - The material looks like it might scratch easily (but I'm trying not to find that out first-hand). At this price -- 3,000 semolians! -- Apple should have included a soft leather sleeve or something, so that you can toss the thus-protected Powerbook into a shoulder bag or backpack and not worry about it. I ordered a neoprene third-party solution called a Sportfolio (40 bucks) that does the job. - I've been forced to use them for years and I still don't like 'em: trackpads. Ugh. Get a mouse. Kensington makes one that works well with a Powerbook; it has a retractable USB cable that stores inside the device when not in use. - The power cord plugs into the side of the machine. That's a bit unsightly. It should have been in the back, where it essentially doesn't show. - More visual clutter: the sides of the machine. They're outfitted with a bevvy of ports, including a Firewire 800 port and an S-video socket (excellent!) and no cover (not so excellent). I realize doors can easily break off, but maybe a molded rubber strip would have (a) been better-looking, and (b) kept dust, dirt, and lint out. - Apple should take a cue from the automobile industry and its included standard 3 year/50,000-miles warranties. The Powerbook has a one-year warranty and only 90 days of phone support. To extend coverage to three full years, you're supposed to purchase a protection plan for -- gulp -- 350 bucks. I guess I'll do it, but I have the uncomfortable feeling I'll be paying for a few years' supply of Steve Jobs's black turtlenecks. I'm OK with him playing hardball with Disney, he just should let up on his own loyal customers a bit. ;-) I've had the G4 17'' Powerbook for a week and intend to really put it through its paces in weeks and months to come. So far, the verdict is very positive. The first Apple Powerbooks, in 1992, also cost multiple thousands of dollars, just like this one. For the same money (less if you count inflation), you can now buy a super-good-looking supercomputer that is a kick-ass music player, an excellent movie-playback machine, a top-notch number cruncher, a high-powered portable recording studio, a serious photo- and video-editing tool, and on and on... I shrugged when I heard about Apple's plans, three or four years ago, to turn their computers into ""hubs for the digital lifestyle."" But the company did just that, and no portable computer today is a more capable, pleasure-to-work-with digital hub than this gorgeous 17'' G4 Powerbook. Addendum: A few weeks after I wrote this review, I'm on a plane, with the Powerbook in its neoprene sleeve tucked safely in the overhead luggage compartment. Well, maybe not SO safely after all. After touchdown, people start grabbing their bags, anxious to get out -- and some idiot yanks her own luggage out so hard and carelessly that my computer goes flying. It drops in a graceless arc, like a limply flung brick, and lands with a thud that churns my stomach. I actually gasp. This is more abuse than any consumer laptop can handle. After all, it's a fall from almost seven feet high; surely the case is cracked, or the screen broken, or the hard drive knocked out of whack and my data lost -- or all of the above. Absurdly enough, though, I'm wrong. I zip open the sleeve, fingers trembling, but all is as it should be. The aluminum case is un-dented and as tight as ever; the screen unblemished; the hard drive unperturbed. Now, I wouldn't care to duplicate this little involuntary experiment. Clearly I got lucky. But it's also proof that Apple builds its Powerbooks with real structural integrity -- equipped to deal with the rigors of the road, and with the abuse inflicted on it by hapless users and clumsy strangers alike.",3

The Mac platform is not only the most powerful one available, it is also the simplest and most versatile - once you learn it. The 15-inch is the perfect size for me. I looked at both the 12 and 17-inch models and felt they were a little too small/big respectively. There is something attractive about the 12 inch - a friend of mine has one and he carries it around everywhere, able to write anywhere anytime. And seated at a desk the 17-inch is also attractive, presenting a massive, bright screen to work on. But all in all, the 15-inch provides the best both worlds. It's very portable - maybe not as easy to tug along as the 12-inch, but certainly manageable with a small backpack. The 17-inch can be problematic on a plane if there are people crowding you, and it's certainly cumbersome to maneuver in tight spaces, whereas the 12-inch is easy to maneuver but can cause a little eyestrain from a distance. I definitely recommend a Mac, first of all, and within that I recommend the 15-inch G4 notebook. If you must have a 12-inch, you might take a look at the 12-inch iBook, which is cheaper but obviously not as feature rich (the iBook's graphics card is not as powerful and the processor is slower, most notably). The complaints I have are exterior - the computer doesn't age well (i.e., it nicks and scratches rather easily) and there should be some sort of elevation device to raise the back end while typing (like the older Powerbooks had). All in all you can't go wrong with any Apple laptop you choose. They are truly making the digital life a reality with all of their integrated software - iTunes, iPhoto, iSight, and the iPod are particularly cool. No other laptop will have an operating system with so many fantastic programs that are so perfectly integrated together. If this is remotely in your price range, go for it. It can literally change the way you operate on a day-to-day basis.",3

This is not the machine you prop up on your legs to read Google News in bed. Hopefully you have something better to do with your US$3K-$4K anyway.

This is a machine to tote onto a job site or to a presentation and produce great work...perfect for freelancers and those who might not work at their home base all the time. Two great things I've not seen other reviewers mention are the audio hardware quality and dual-monitor support; these can't be under-rated. My Dell PC's audio line out is noisy and full of hiss, while the Powerbook's line out is so quiet that many musicians simply plug it into a club's audio system and it sounds great. Dual-monitor support is second to none. After chafing a bit at the widescreen nature of the screen (i.e., only 900 pixels tall), I instantly shut my mouth when I plugged in another monitor and it immediately started running at 1600 x 1200. While there are some compromises one must make in going mobile, this machine does not disappoint. Rear legs for improved elevation, easy expandability, even a real tray for the DVD-RW drive ... all these things have been removed to make the machine as streamlined as possible. But I happily accept all these compromises to use a Macintosh that is powerful, relatively lightweight, portable...and sexy as all get-out.

"Sony VAIO PCG-V505DX Laptop (1.40-GHz Pentium M (Centrino), 512 MB RAM, 60 GB Hard Drive, DVD/CD-RW Combo Drive)","This new laptop replaces a Toshiba A15-S127 that we bought 3 months ago and one that died 4 weeks later when the LCD screen cracked. This one still confuses my wife and me given that the thing spent most of its time in its carry case and it bore absolutely no external damage on the laptop's shell. To add insult to injury the store we bought it from wanted to charge us literally 2/3rds the cost of the thing to repair it, manufacturer's warranty be dammed, I guess. Suffice it to say that we won't be buying Toshiba products again nor shopping at this store (who's name, by the way, rhymes with Stomp Youse Say), ever again. I would have reviewed the S127, but what's the point? We hardly had it long enough to get to know it. When Sony began producing computers, I was less than impressed. Yet another big name producing very shiny products that look great while using second rate parts that deliver underwhelming performance. That was several years ago and while I still don't care for big name brand PCs, they are still good machines. Even though I build my PCs from parts I choose, I can't build a lap top, and after the Toshiba debacle, anything would have been an improvement. Truth to tell, I didn't really like the Toshiba from the start, but my wife wanted something cheap to take to work and use it to learn Spanish, practice her mathematics and watch the occasional movie, and the Toshiba did a fair job at all of those things. The Sony PCG-505DX is a vast improvement in every category, though it was twice the price. The 505 features a 1.5 Ghz Pentium 4 Centrino processor- possibly the most important consideration when buying a laptop these days. The CPU scales its speed and processing ability to conserve power and extend the usability of the lap top. With the full charge the 505 will run for nearly 5 hours when doing things like word processing. Obviously, the more things you do, the shorter the battery life will be. The Vaio also sports a whopping 512 mb of RAM, an ATI Mobility Radeon 9200 with 16 mb of its own RAM, (a lot of laptops video RAM is actually shared with system RAM and performance takes a real hit), a 400 Mhz FSB, an 11 mb IEEE 802.11b `Wi-fi' wireless network adapter, 1 PC-MCIA slot, 2 USB + 1 IEEE 1394 FireWire ports, CD-RW & DVD player combo drive, Network and modem ports, VGA port, and a Sony memory stick slot. All of this is packed into a very small and very attractive box,. The casing also has a lot of polished aluminum, which will no doubt enhance the durability and life of the computer. Though the S127 was fully 600 Mhz faster, the 505 out performs it every category- it boots faster, loads programs faster, and came with much better software pre-installed. I actually plan to keep all of Sony's own music and video programs, which is odd as I usually spend the first day or so with any laptop I have owned blowing out all the junk and promotional software that comes with them. About the only things I removed was AOL and that really terrible office package known as Microsoft Works. Everything else will stay. Sony also wisely partitioned the 60 Gb hard drive to make mirroring the drive much easier. (What they didn't include was a system restore CD or DVD and instead require you to make your own. If you want to do this, make sure your have a stack of CD-Rs handy, because it will take 9 of them). The 505 is actually pretty much the same size as my old 486 Compaq Aero, which itself was a dynamite little machine. I love the Vaio's design and feel- it's sturdy, incredibly well made and given the luck we have had with our other Sony products, I suspect this little beauty will be around for a long time. About the only real complaints I have about it is the speakers sound terrible, but then again, this is a laptop and a general gripe about laptop keyboards in general- I just can't get comfortable with any of them. This is the best laptop I have ever owned in both performance and build quality. The screen image quality is great, the keys and controls intuitive, I only wish we had bought this first instead of the Toshiba.",3
"Sony VAIO PCG-V505DX Laptop (1.40-GHz Pentium M (Centrino), 512 MB RAM, 60 GB Hard Drive, DVD/CD-RW Combo Drive)","It may be too late to help anyone looking to buy a Sony notebook computer, but still I feel I should leave for posterity my experiences with the Sony PCG-V505DX. I bought it in Nov. 2003. I work as a translator, and was looking for a solid, easy-to-carry laptop with long battery life that I could take with me and work with anywhere. This computer certainly met the criteria in every way, so I was very pleased at first. However, within two weeks of purchase, I had a premonition of what was to come when the key cap for the slash/question mark key fell off and could not be put back on. I called Sony about this, and their only solution was for me to send it in for warranty service (which would take two weeks minimum) and get it replaced. They couldn't just send me a new key cap. Sending it was not an option for me because I needed the computer for my daily work, and I was afraid the bumps and vibrations of shipping it would likely cause worse problems than a missing key cap. So I carefully pried off the cap for the menu key (which I never use) and replaced the missing one with it. (Later I had the same experience with the Insert key, but I just left it off, since I never touch type that key. When I want to switch from insert to overwrite, I just press the plastic button that sits under the keycap.) The computer worked okay for a while. Then about a year after I bought it, the CD/DVD drive started having problems. It would read DVDs but not most CDs. This is really a pain when installing software. This problem just seems to get worse and worse, and I think soon it will not read DVDs either. In Jan. 2005, when I was traveling, I tried to use a wireless connnection service in Korea. Somehow my entire wireless capability got wiped out. Now I cannot connect to wireless by any means, including the onboard wireless or through cards in the PCMCIA slot on the side. Since wireless was one of the major needs I had when I bought it, this is really a problem. But that's not all. Shortly after the problem with the wireless, the door came off from the PCMCIA slot, which also no longer works. Also the USB port on the left side doesn't work, although the one on the right does. Right now, I can't afford to buy another computer. So I'm stuck using this one. It still performs basic computing functions, and is still lightweight and has a reasonably long battery life, but it has been a terrible disappointment to me. I have had similar experiences with other Sony products I have bought recently, including a Clie TJ35 handheld device which failed two weeks after I bought it, only to replaced by another that did exactly the same thing, caused by what turned out to be a known problem with the display. That device had to be sent back four times during its one year warranty period, before finally dying out completely just about a month after the warranty was up. I figure I only got about 8 months of use out of it. A previous Clie I had also died almost exacty the day the warranty ran out. Sony's customer support is legendary in its lack of helpfulness. Usually you get connected to someone in India whose only response is to order a kit to send the compter back for service, which can easily take a month. The forth time my handheld came back from service, they didn't even secure it in the box. They just threw it in there with a handful of foam peanuts, and it was rattling loose the whole way. The service center is in San Diego, and I live in San Diego, but they wouldn't let me bring the computer there. I had to send it by FedEx. I've owned seven noteboks so far. This Sony is by far the worst I've had. The three Toshibas, the two Tandys, and the Gateway all worked perfectly far beyond their expected life, even with rough service. The Sony is just a shell of what I paid for. It's so sad what poor engineering, non-existant quality control, and useless customer support have done to the once proud Sony name. I will never buy another product from them again. I am totally fed up.",3

"Sony VAIO PCG-FRV37 Laptop (2.80-GHz Pentium 4, 512 MB RAM, 60 GB Hard Drive, DVD-RW/CD-RW Drive)","If you are looking for a portable computer this SONY is simply awesome. A notebook or laptop it is not; its big and heavy by todays standards but the performance is fantastic! The Gateway desktop died (will never buy from them again) and couldn't be brought back to life so I decided to pick up a ""notebook"". The FRV37 is blazing fast, the screen is large, bright and clear & its got plenty of HD space (if you need more consider getting an external USB hard drive). With a CD and a DVD burner you really don't need a desktop machine anymore. It comes with a nice software bundle. Its got firewire built in and is great for capturing video from digital video cameras. If you go on vacation, take this computer, a Sony or Canon Digitial video cam and an Olympus digital camera and everyone on the trip can go home with CDs or DVDs of the trip. Buy this machine if you want to replace your desktop, you don't need long bettery life (it gets about 2 hours max), and you want something portable but not light weight. The only thing missing is built in wireless but for about $50.00 you can get a wireless card that will do the trick. This computer has NEVER crashed unlike all previous computers (desktops from Gateway) that crashed frequently. Only 4 stars because its heavy, has short battery life and missing built in wireless.",3
"Sony VAIO PCG-FRV37 Laptop (2.80-GHz Pentium 4, 512 MB RAM, 60 GB Hard Drive, DVD-RW/CD-RW Drive)","i bought this machine because it was relatively cheap and i wanted something portable with a lot of processing power. I have never wanted for processing speed, and i can take the thing around places, so my basic needs are satisfied. The problems: A) low battery life. My battery life is now about 20 minutes. When i got it, the life was ~1.5 hours. I'm guessing that this is what happens when you overcharge a battery constantly by having the laptop plugged in all the time. Apple has solved this problem, why can't sony? B) heavy. and the ac adapter is HUGE, about the size of a psp/1st gen. gameboy. Will fit in backpack, but it will weigh you down. It's fine to carry - so long as its the only thing you're carrying. C) hot. i highly recommend a centrino processor. p4s are just too hot for a laptop. They burn the battery and the computer occasionally shuts off b/c it's too hot. These problems are endemic to p4 laptops. Get a centrino. Overall i am satisfied, if not ecstatic.",3
"Sony VAIO PCG-FRV37 Laptop (2.80-GHz Pentium 4, 512 MB RAM, 60 GB Hard Drive, DVD-RW/CD-RW Drive)",I've had this machine just over a week now. So far I like it. I took off one star because it doesn't have built in wireless. I chose this machine because it had the best display of the machines I looked at under $1500.00 (I paid $ 1350.00) at Circuit City. The keyboard and display are both very nice. The sound is not great but it was better than two Toshiba machines I was looking at. It has USB 2.0 and Firewire. It also has an ATI Radeon chip with 64mb of shared RAM. I was able to make restore disks using two DVD-R and one CD-R with no trouble and free up the restore partition on the hard drive. I benchmarked my machine using SiSoft Sandra 2003 and came up with performance expected of a 2.8 Ghz Pentium 4. I should point out that I am technically experienced. I had my own business repairing and upgrading computers. Maybe the process of creating the restore disks is more challenging for others. All in all I think I got good value for my money and would recommend someone looking for a laptop in the $ 1500.00 at least take a look at the Vaio FRV37.,3
"Sony VAIO PCG-FRV37 Laptop (2.80-GHz Pentium 4, 512 MB RAM, 60 GB Hard Drive, DVD-RW/CD-RW Drive)","First of all, even though this is a 60 gig drive, you only get 50 g of usable space. Seems they reserved 10g for restoring. You are supposed to be able to use some dvd-rw to restore it (there is no restore cd included), however, it won't let me. I'm not about to sit down w/ 10+ cd-r's to do this. They give you lots of software, but nothing that great. I had been using an old version of Quicken. The Quicken 2003 that came with it would not let me import the info w/o buying the upgraded version. All in all it's a good package though. the documentation that comes in the box is more ad's for sony products than actual info on your $1600 investment. I can't find out the actual dvd burning speed, but it appears that it is only 1x. boo This barely gets the fourth star. Good, but could have been better.",3

I keep getting a write error when making recovery DVD's, ruined 4 of them already. They were going to suggest I do the 10 CD method but before it was out of the mouth, I said nope. Then they wanted to send me recovery DVDs for free, but why does the DVD writer keep having a write-error from the get go. Reminds me of a Toshiba I once owned that I could not make recovery work after making floppies for recovery (24 of THEM!) that was junk from Day 1 and eventually had a class action suit against them that Toshiba lost, but the settlement was puny considering the grief that thing gave me. Now, Sony has to go back. CSR said he would take it back rather than take the free recovery DVDs, too. That's good enough for me. Do I give them another chance, or do I buy something else?",3

"IBM ThinkPad T41 (2379DJU) Laptop (1.60 GHz Pentium M (Centrino), 256 MB RAM, 40 GB Hard Drive, DVD/CD-RW Combo)","Oh, Thinkpad, how do I love thee? Let me count the ways! I have never had a refurbished machine, so I was wary about glitches and bugs--but when my computer arrived, all my fears were laid to rest. This machine is huge, heavy, and STURDY AS BALLS. This is NOT a hoity-hoity little Macbook air that you're going to be afraid of breaking if you look crossways at it. This, my friends, is a F$#@ing Thinkpad. This guy eats 5 dozen eggs for breakfast. He can lift up a bench with three buxom lasses on it. He uses antlers in all of his decorating. Get the picture? Good. He is HEAVY and HUGE and I have named mine Moose. Now, granted, this is not a guy you can watch movies on, or play games on. This is definitely a computer for writing and surfing the web and basics like that. He CAN stream pandora or another music service, but tends to skip sometimes if you're doing anything else. He has a bit of trouble with flash-heavy webpages, but a good flashblocker add-on can help him with that. Budget your programs with him, don't ask him to do too much. I usually limit myself to a chat program (and I use Trillian 3.1 and AIM 5.9), Word, and Chrome. Definitely use the most streamlined versions of things on this guy, and he'll do you fine. Of course, there is the little matter of you being able to add space, speed, and so on with him. Thinkpads are probably the best kind of machine for upgrading. He's got space for more inside his casing, which is more than you can say for newer machines, that are just meant to be thrown out after a year. Another bonus is the full-size keyboard, the two types of mouse (a touchpad and the pointing stick, the latter of which has a middle button which I'm sure does SOMETHING but I don't know what), the very sturdy mouse-buttons (they're loud but push down satisfyingly), the status lights at the bottom of the monitor, and the little white LED on the top of the monitor, that illuminates the keyboard in the dark. There are also page forward and page back buttons on either side of the up key. I would say that if you're a writer in need of a laptop that'll survive the long haul, or if you're someone who appreciates a machine that will last you years instead of months, get this. Ffs there's a review in here from someone who's had their machine for five years! This guy won't steer you wrong, people.",4

Love the keyboard and the access IBM help. I have called tech support for information and help with software installations and driver updates and they were very good and patient with all my detailed questions. This is important to me... to have good tech support available. This T41 comes with a 3 year warranty. IBM's website has excellent support. I love the automated stuff where it analyzes your computer and tells you what updates you need. Sometimes their driver upgrades are more for the IT person. But, just download their software installer and it works great. However, you must focus...if you want to understand what you have downloaded. Not totally for the novice. Tech support walked me thru it once and I was on my way. So far so good after only a month, the T41 rocks! Particularly the higher-end graphics card, glad I went for that. I can tell the difference when comparing with my desktop LCD. The CD burner works well and I use Nero 6. I had been using a 4x burner on my desktop and this one writes at 24x...what a difference.

IBM THINKPAD R51 CENTRINO-735 512MB ( 18308TU ),"tl;dr Get this laptop for simple tasks like word processing or checking e-mail. Not best for entertainment purposes like watching dvds, gaming, and Skype calling. Clearly this is a cheap laptop and it's cheap for a reason. This laptop was manufactured by IBM who are famous for their Lenovo technology. Lenovo is a fairly good brand, so that's a plus. Pros: + price: It costed $130 used. + keyboard: I freakin' love typing on this thing. It has a nice feel. Don't judge me. Cons: - slow: It has a 1.6 GHz processor. What do you expect. It takes a while to start up and is kind of slow switching between tabs in Google Chrome depending on the level of content on a page and the number of tabs you have up. - clunky: This thing weighs about 11 pounds. The design is old looking & clunky. if you feel embarrassed using a dinosaur-looking machine, either don't use it in public or don't buy it. Haha. I got this laptop because I just needed a device to type my papers for my silly ENC1102 class. The reason why I got a laptop instead of a netbook was because of price and the laptop had a more comfortable viewing & typing size. I occasionally roam around Youtube, but its speed is fine. It may be a bit laggy at times if you're watching a DVD. Overall, this is a decent laptop for simple computing. Works best for word processing... anything productive. It fits all my needs for school.

So I contacted the rebuilders I ordered from...they say they will get with me...three times we make email contact, and no getting with me.

I restarted it and the internet connected fine, after 5 times of reconnecting and connecting again. It could not have been my internet because I went to the library and it did the same thing. Also, I had to buy a new battery for it because I had to keep the charger in the laptop or it would shut off in 5 minutes, no matter how long i charged it. Another thing is that the charger jack was loose. I got 3 chargers for it. With all of them, I had to wiggle the charger around for 5 minutes just to use it. And when I was typing an essay or something and not paying attention to the battery life, It would black out and I would not have saved any of my work, thus having to type it again. After some time it just stopped working altogether! This happened so many times. I'm very disappointed with this product because I spent so much money on not only it, but accessories for it, and I was hardly ever satisfied with it..",3

Laptop HP Compaq NC6230,"I've been using one for about 4 months now without any issues. I guess it depends what you expect from it. I spent about $150, I got a little more RAM (1gb)... it's perfectly fine for browsing, emailing and watching videos on youtube.",3
Laptop HP Compaq NC6230,I have owned/used more than 4 of these computers. Every single one has had a major hardware failure within 6 months. This laptop is actually worse than HP's from a few years ago (if possible). The volume control doesn't even work. The case is flimsy and will crack easily. Hard drive fails and thrashes constantly. Screen resolution constantly reverting back to lowest setting. VOIP microphone only works when plugged directly into the laptop (won't work when plugged into the dock). Avoid this computer if you can.,3
IBM Thinkpad T43 1.86GHz 512MB 40GB Laptop Notebook CDRW/DVD Windows XP Pro,"I got this in 2017 and I love it. First of all this is the pre-Lenovo Thinkpad classic design. Second of all it comes preloaded with Windows XP with the CD-Rom and USB ports that work in that vintage. What is this good for? Accessing old external hard drives that don't map with Windows 7 and up, playing DVDs without any of the new Windows 10 playback bugs especially on international region DVDs, and perfect for a little kid who asks for a Laptop for Christmas. This is way cheaper than an IPad and if used only for Internet and emails this is more reliable and versatile than an IPad. Just one caveat- speakers work best on only certain internet browsers. Think it doesn't work on Chrome for some reason.",4
IBM Thinkpad T43 1.86GHz 512MB 40GB Laptop Notebook CDRW/DVD Windows XP Pro,"I would give this IBM ThinkPad T43 a 10 Star if they were to give it to me! Using it now. I immediately upgraded to 2 GB Ram. I also bought more Caddys and 3 more hard drives. I have purchased about everything that is available for this ThinkPad/ Do Not buy the cheaper UltraBay hard drive sled - JUNK!! and you'll fight with it going in and out. Buy the IBM, do yourself a real favor! You can go to the IBM website for this ThinkPad and download all of the software and BIOS Upgrades for this laptop. Originally the BIOS is Version 1.0 or 1.09 There is a Version 1.29 which upgrades the BIOS to a 2009 model year. The last year for this laptop was 12/2005 Would I buy one again? you Betcha! Mine has the 128MB Video and is the 15 Inch monitor! I use this laptop more than my three Desktop PC's which are way more powerful than this laptop. But the Laptop is so Handy! I paid I thin $130. and is worth every bit of it - this one is an Off-Lease. I don't think it was used much by the Leaser. It looked new when I got it. I have been running a 40 GB hard drive with Linux Mint 14 and love it! Ubuntu is okay, but there are a lot of not well thought out stuff and some things don't work where as Linux Mint, it does! I have found a few other Linux distros that work very well with the Laptop too. I am looking at buying another T43, yea! I love it that much!",4
IBM Thinkpad T43 1.86GHz 512MB 40GB Laptop Notebook CDRW/DVD Windows XP Pro,"I bought this for my two grade-school children to play educational mathematics games on line. I did simultaneously order a 1-gb memory card to increase memory size, which was easy enough to install (remove 512 mg chip by unscrewing hatch on bottom of computer; insert replacement chip. Done). That only added $12 to the total. It works fine for the limited tasks I want it to do. Cosmetically in perfect condition. Screen is in good shape. The one odd thing that caught my attention had to do with one software program that was installed, which I had not expected to be installed: PowerPoint. I was glad to have it, but there were a few fragments of old PowerPoint presentations still on the machine, from some business that had owned the computer before. It wasn't much, but usually refurbished computers won't have anyone's old data at all. Keep in mind that by current standards, the disk drive is small and the processor is slow. Still, my two kids love it. They had wanted a ""real computer"" of their own, and now they have one.",4
IBM Thinkpad T43 1.86GHz 512MB 40GB Laptop Notebook CDRW/DVD Windows XP Pro,"For the price of this laptop it's unbeatable. It actually came with Windows 7 installed and not XP. I was a little concerned at first that it might have trouble running Windows 7 but so far so good. This is really just a back up for me and all I really need to do is surf the net, send emails maybe watch an occasional video. It's running great, surfs the net with good speed, boots up pretty quickly. The only thing that seems a little lacking is the battery life. I usually have it plugged in anyway so it's not a big deal for me, but I used it for a while last night running on the battery just to test out the life. Not terrible but not great. It lasted a couple hours before I had to plug it back in. All things considered, I am very happy with this laptop. If you are looking for something to use for simple applications and surfing the web then you really can't go wrong here.",4
IBM Thinkpad T43 1.86GHz 512MB 40GB Laptop Notebook CDRW/DVD Windows XP Pro,"So it isn't sleek and streamlined like your modern laptops. Not like I plan on racing the thing. I do find the black matte metal case incredibly appealing, like I could run over it and it would still work, or perhaps use it to bash apart a fancy new laptop. The main reason I bought this computer was because I needed to free up some hard drive space on my PC so the games had to go. I got a free memory/hard drive upgrade with my ThinkPad so I've been merrily cramming it with resource-hog games and they play loads better than I'd expected. I may load a few graphics programs to see how well they work. Like older laptops it does get quite hot which makes the DVD/CD drive a bit cranky sometimes but my last desktop PC did the same thing so I can deal with it. The fan is a bit loud but not distracting. I probably have the original battery because it's only good for about two hours but since I normally use the power cord anyhow it hasn't been a problem. I may order a new battery if I start carrying it around. Big ""meh"" on the nipple mouse. I haven't gotten the hang of it and for the moment it's disabled but I'll give it another go since it is staring at me with that baleful red eye.",4
IBM Thinkpad T43 1.86GHz 512MB 40GB Laptop Notebook CDRW/DVD Windows XP Pro,"It was an affordable laptop for me. It worked ok for 7 months Unfortunately, the technology is out of date so that when it got a virus a few monts ago I've had a hard time getting it fixed. Someone is presently trying to repair it. I gave it to friend's ex wife to fix, but she never did anything with it so I had to see if I could get it repaired somewhere else. Had to go out and get a new one.",4
Toshiba Satellite A75-s209 P4,"The display is beautiful! The speed is fast. The wireless is flawless. And it heats up when gaming and SHUTS OFF! Often. The cooling fans are: One on the right side (right where you'd have your trackball/mouse, and two on the bottom of the machine. ""Do not block the fans"" they say. Well, um, I don't possess the skills to levitate the machine off a flat surface, so that's out. I bought some fancy laptop cooler thing to set the machine on. It does not help. After a few months of owning this laptop, this problem seems to be getting worse. The only thing I could do to stop the overheating was to buy a small 6 inch fan with a clamp on it, clamp it to my desk, and point it directly at the rear of the laptop. This is poorly designed in my opinion. From reading other reviews around the world, I understand this model has been discontinued, Toshiba customer service is an abomination, and the speakers are made of metal and there is a shock/reboot problem on some machines. 0_o And if that is not enough for ya, it periodically boots with the sound disabled. Only way to get it working again is to unplug the power, take out the battery, and hold the power button for one minute. FUN! Oh yeah, and no internal mic. AVOID.",2
Toshiba Satellite A75-s209 P4,this computer is so slow.the screen freezes every 10 days so when it freezes i have to take out the battery.this crap wastes all my time.when installing 1 simple program it takes at least 10-20 minutes for the program to be instaled.i had to fix this computer twice in the last month.another big problem is the overheating.the 1st day i got the computer it started heating up so rapidly i could not stop it.now i have to carry a portable fan where ever i go so it does not overheat.every time you have a 50 50 percent chance of having internet connection.it takes a long time to load a page on the web and it takes a long time load programs and send mail.im a macintosh kind of guy. i have no clue why i bought this pile of crap in the first place.i will never buy a toshiba again.id recomend buying a macintosh.well anyway have fun dealing with this box full of crap.,2
Toshiba Satellite A75-s209 P4,"I just got this laptop back from the repair shop. Thank God I bought the warranty because the system board and the DVD drive needed replacement. It no longer overheats, but the DVD drive still does not open. The screen is beautiful and the machine is fast. The headaches regarding this laptop are more than you'd like. Do yourself a favor and shop around. I thought Toshiba was top of the line. I still think highly of Toshiba, just not this model. Good luck!",2
Toshiba Satellite A75-s209 P4,"This laptop is so fast with the Pent.4. It does overheat when you buy it because of a defect, but once you get the toshiba depot to fix it the problem goes away. I would recommend this laptop to everyone",2

I've never written a review on Amazon, but after it finally croaked completely I felt obligated to. When I first received this computer, it didn't work. I had to contact HP to order recovery disks. After running the disks the computer did run. About a month ago, the screen would begin to go black and freeze periodically. Again, this laptop is a little over a year old. The screen issue began to be more frequent. I took it to an HP service provider. He told me the hard drive may need to be replaced ($200 parts & labor) or the mother-board would need to be replaced (approx $800 parts & labor). I went the cheaper route and guess what - it didn't fix the issue. So, since I am not forking over another $800, the laptop is junked. EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTING",3

Gateway M305crv Pentium 4 or Celeron Black Laptop,"This came in the mail on the 4th day of me ordering. I was expecting a dirty sticker covered laptop when it came but when I received it, the computer was very clean and had a fresh install of XP. All the drivers were pre Installed and the time was set. It is a very clean though the only thing I wish it had was a wireless card (I found one for $3.99). Thank you seller for this great and clean product.",4
Gateway M305crv Pentium 4 or Celeron Black Laptop,"I have owned a Gateway M305CRV for nearly 4 years. The processor is a 2.4GHz mobile celeron and I installed 1GB of Ram (system max). I also upgraded the hard drive to 100GB, which the system handles with no issues. Despite the fact that the processor is the older single core vs. the newer dual core intel and AMD models, the performance is still comparable. I use the sytem for surfing the web, e-mail, photo editing, some video editing, and standard word and spreadsheet processing. I have also used it periodically for database development in Access. While you cannot use the more demanding programs (such as Access or photoshop elements) simultaneously without bogging the system down somewhat, the performance is still on par with newer processors for working in a single application. I have owned several different models of the Gateway laptops and Dell laptops, and I find in general that the Gateway models seem more efficient that the Dells. The downside of the Gateway's is the customer service. If you don't need tech support and can do your own upgrades for most items you would want to change (such as RAM, hard drive, optical drive, etc.) don't be afraid of a Gateway.",4
Gateway M305crv Pentium 4 or Celeron Black Laptop,"I got this laptop 7 or 8 years ago. I'm just now looking to replace it and that it how I stumbled I came upon these reviews. Maybe I've been very lucky, but I'd have to say that this laptop has done it's job very well. For starters, I needed something cheap (~$750, as I recall) that could primarily perform basic tasks. No probs there. And no others for the last 8 years, with the exception that the battery did die on my a few years ago. That's a bummer, but, I think, a common problem not limited to Gateway. Now, the power connection or the AC adapter itself is having problems and sometimes it goes on an extended jag of giving me pop up msgs that I need to reconnect the AC because the battery is about dead. Also, one of the keyboard letters got stuck at a weird angle and I popped it off trying to fix it. That'll never go back on. Along with everything else, screen technology has improved greatly so my screen looks pretty dull compared to newer machines. Still, we are talking about a very old laptop, here. If my next one gives me anywhere near this level of service I'll be a very happy man.",4
Gateway M305crv Pentium 4 or Celeron Black Laptop,"I originally got this laptop from Gateway around 7 years ago, it's been the goto computer on the go for me; I've upgraded the memory last year to 1GB and since then it's been able to handle any of the day to day stuff that most people would do (word processing, e-mail) without experiencing any slowdowns; I'm running WinXP SP3 with the usual anti-mal, anti virus software I can work on my digital photos with freeware programs like GIMP, and even play some older 3D games (although, if you push it, it will get hot and lead to a system crash, making a reboot necessary), it handles 2D games without issues All in all, it's more than paid for itself, i would upgrade it more with a bigger HD if i could find one at a good price",4
Gateway M305crv Pentium 4 or Celeron Black Laptop,"I've owned a Gateway M305CRV for over 3 years with absolutely no issues. And I bought this thing used as a refurbished unit from Gateway via a third-party reseller online. It only came with a 90 day warranty from Gateway, but I was able to contact Gateway and get the warranty extended to a full 3 year deal (I had to pay for the extension of course). But it turned out I didn't need the warranty at all, it expired in March without me using it. When I first bought this laptop I worked for a University in North Carolina that was a authorized Gateway service center (which is why I bought a Gateway). Of course since I got the laptop, Gateway has gone from being shaky to downright awful. Selling a large part of their core systems to MPC and outsourcing virtually everything.",4
Gateway M305crv Pentium 4 or Celeron Black Laptop,"I understand some of the complaints but for the most part it sometimes comes down to whether or not you were unlucky enough to just get a bad system from the company. Fortunately, like most, I got a perfect working Gateway M305CRV years ago and it still bulldozes through whenever I need it to. Powerful enough to use high graphics software like Photoshop CS3 and connects to internet perfectly. I've never had any system problems (other than the ones I brought upon myself lol). The bad reviews are probably true but I think it's because they had a bad system. Notice there are only a few?? lol The rest, like me got the real deal. D*** fine computer! I have to say 5 stars for longevity, reliability, and utility. They can't all be winners, but mine definitely was.",4
Gateway M305crv Pentium 4 or Celeron Black Laptop,"I had the Gateway M305CRV for about eight years and it still runs fine to this day. Sure the fan is a little loud, but this computer will never die. Mine has even been run over by a car, don't ask, and all i had to do was get the screen replaced and it worked perfectly again. I get mine cleaned out every 2 years or so, which makes it run like new. I dont think I know anyone who has a laptop that is eight years old, been through what mine has and still runs. This laptop rules!",4
Gateway M305crv Pentium 4 or Celeron Black Laptop,"You'll notice the first of many problems with this computer when you turn it on, as might be expected. The noise output of the fan is on par with a 747 at about 1/4 throttle. I bought this thing for school and used it once in a 90 person lecture hall for about 3 minutes. Everyone in the entire room could hear it. You would think that a fan that loud would keep this beast cool. Nope. If you try to run more than one program at a time, particularly anything with non-static graphics, this mother will shut off due to overheating. I will say this for it though, it continues to run after 5 years. That may be just to spite me though.",4
