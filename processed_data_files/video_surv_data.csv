Jobar International RET3731 Driveway Patrol,"It's cheap, but does the trick. Product placement is the key, both for the sensor to pick up people and cars, and the receiver to pick up the signal from the sensor. Play around with it until you get it just right. For me, I found it best to point the sensor a little more toward where cars and people approach my property. I built a shelter out of a wooden fence section for the sensor to protect it from rain and attached the shelter to a tree next to my driveway (see the picture that I posted). Is this thing perfect? No. For this price, what do you expect. But for me, it will do just fine. In fact, I already ordered a second kit so that the back side of my property is covered too.",3
Jobar International RET3731 Driveway Patrol,"I bought this after reading the mixed reviews and decided to take a chance. In my situation it worked pretty well with few false alarms here and there. I installed it to a beam on the front porch, which alerts me anyone standing in my front door that didn't ring the bell. This usually applies to drop-off of smaller items from Amazon, and other carriers. Now whenever a packaged is dropped off without ringing my bell, I will know immediately when I'm home! As for sensitivity, my porch is pretty much blocked off/closed off in most directions so it only has a small area to detect. Only one direction has a tree 30 feet in sight. There has been false alarm whenever wind blows hard enough to cause the branches and leafs to move. I understand this device has pretty good range, so that's understandable. Do make sure you put in batteries that have similar charges left (or brand new). I first put any available batteries (including one that's 3/4 drained), and it wouldn't receive the signal from the motion sensor consistently. This warning is given in the small instruction manual, but who reads that first!",3
Jobar International RET3731 Driveway Patrol,"I have Six of these units around the perimeter of my property and have been using them for up to three years now. During that time I have experimented with placement to get the best balance between false alarms and not picking anything up so here are some tips I have found. Sensor placement; 1) Avoid pointing toward rising or setting sun as you might get false alarms in the morning or evening. Also if it is in a place where the shadows of tree leaves moving on the lens will give you false alarms also. 2) As most PIR detectors, they are least sensitive to objects moving toward them as opposed to side to side so keep this in mind when you place them. 3) I found that a height of 7 feet works well in an open area like a yard or parking spot and 5 feet if you want a small area like doorstep small deck. 4) Make sure the sensor is mounted very solid so it will not move. I use the mounting hole and velcro on the back. 5) Although I have done it, These units are not sealed enough to just hang out in the weather as water will eventually seep in through the front lens or where the case mates. I run a small bead if silicone around the case joints and along the bottom of the lens area and case to keep the driving rain out and have several that are attached to a telephone pole for two years and are still working. Or you could put it in a birdhouse in the right application. Range of the unit. I consistently get 300 feet or more with these as long as the sensor and reciever are placed well. 1) The sensors antena is in the back of the unit so if it is pointing in the direction of your reciever the range will be reduced by almost half in my experience. Side on works ok but if your looking for range beyond 200' you wont get it unless its at 45 degrees or straight on. 2) DO NOT mount the unit on anything metal or have metal between the sensor and the reciever otherwise your range will be greatly affected, this goes for the reciever as well. 3) The less things that are in the path of the sensor and the reciever the better. I like to put the reciever/s in a window on the same side of the house as the sensor for the best results. 4) Battery condition in sensor affects range. Limitations 1) come on guys, its a $15.00 unit! , you cant buy a good PIR detector for less than $40.00 let alone wireless and a reciever. It's not human presence detection system. Place the units correctly and it will give you a pretty good idea if someone is around or comes in the driveway. 2) Since it relies on changes in the heat signature, it might not pick up a car that was sitting in the sun all day and the same teprature as the the area in front of it. Its pretty good especially if the car drives by the unit not toward it. Its a $5.00 sensor element if that but works well for what it is. 3) I have only had one bad unit out of about a dozen so thats not bad but you can get a bad one. Just ensure you go through the tips above before you give up on the unit. 4) if you buy multiple units it is hit and miss with the frequency settings which you cant change. You might get 3 units that work with the same reciver or have 1 that only works with its reciver. I have six right now working on two different recievers so one is the front of the house and in the front window and one for the back. I hope this helps anyone with these units out. Cheers.",3
Jobar International RET3731 Driveway Patrol,"The outdoor sensor unit worked great; no problem at all there. Two problems, however, with the indoor receiver chime. First and foremost, it wouldn't work. Batteries, fully charged and new, were inserted properly, but no chiming occurred when the sensor was tripped. The separate problem was with the battery cover on the inside chiming unit. When my husband slid the battery cover back in, the two small pieces of plastic that hold the bottom of the door in place broke off. So, the battery door would no longer hold. If the unit would just have worked, putting duct tape on the battery cover to hold it into place would have been fine with us. A working unit means more to me here than its aesthetics. Reality is, though, that we're in such a fast production line age that we can't expect every product we buy to work. Lemons get through the system. Unfortunately, in this case, one of those lemons made its way to my house.",3
GE Personal Security Door Stop Alarm,"I bought this door stop alarm to use on my outside door each night. My wife and I live in an apartment in the city and it is always a smart idea to have a little extra security. As you can tell by the picture that I provided it is a relatively straight forward design. It is about the same size, maybe slightly larger, than the usually door stops you would see at your school or office. If you look at the picture of the bottom of it you will see that there is a piece of rubber on the bottom that helps to keep it from moving with the door when it opens. I have tested it several times and the rubber piece does a good job to keep it in place. However, I have had it slide across the floor one time when I was testing. Since that scared me a little bit, I now use an extra piece of tape on the bottom of it when it is in use. Works like a charm now! The level of noise seems to be pretty darn loud. It is loud enough that when I go to test it before bed, and my wife is near it, I usually get a look of disgust from her annoyance. We can easily hear it from about 30 feet away through a bedroom door. The battery life has been pretty amazing. We have had it for about a year and a half and we are just now having to replace the battery. (hence why I thought to write this review). Overall: This is a great supplement to home security and very well priced! I give it 4 stars simply because of the rubber on the bottom not being sticky enough, but this is easily fixed with a small piece of tape. Otherwise I highly recommend! I have also attached photos! Thanks.",3
GE Personal Security Door Stop Alarm,"I've been using this for about 3 years and here are some tips for using the GE Smart Home Door Stop Alarm. 1. Before purchasing make sure you have enough door spacing that the door stop alarm can be activated by the door opening and depressing the metal activator on the door stop alarm. (If there is not enough spacing then it will just push the stopper away from the door and won't go off) 2. When putting it in your baggage or luggage for travel I recommend either taking the battery out so it doesn't accidentally turn on in your bag or putting a piece of tape over the switch so it doesn't move. 3. When placing the device in your door, give it a test by opening the door and checking that it will activate the alarm. You can also place something heavy behind the door stop alarm so that it won't slide when the door is opened and touches it, raising the chances that it will depress the activator. 4. Make sure you keep some spare 9V batteries around for this and that you have one before you throw this in your bag. Check the battery by testing the alarm before you pack it away. 5. Place this on your door at every hotel you visit. This also makes a great gift for frequent travelers. 6. You need a small Phillips head to access the battery compartment. If you have more feel free to add them below. Thanks! 4.5 stars for it being too easy to accidentally switch the alarm to on in your bag and a pain in the butt to change the battery. You need a small Phillips head to access the battery compartment.",3
GE Personal Security Door Stop Alarm,"Purchased one each of GE Personal Security Alarm and SABRE Door Stop Alarm for comparison test. The SABRE and GE are very comparable in cost, size, and weight, but the SABRE's features far surpass the GE's. The SABRE's alarm can be heard throughout our 3,800 sq. foot home and is MUCH, MUCH LOUDER than the GE's. GE's alarm stops as soon as the door pressure against it is released, while the SABRE's alarm only stops after the ON/OFF switch on the back of the unit is turned off. Based on my 26 years of experience as a police officer I feel confident in assuring you that the SABRE is far and away the best choice for a very inexpensive, simple to use, and highly efficient door alarm system. I believe the GE Personal Security Door Stop Alarm will disappoint, but the SABRE Door Stop Alarm will exceed your highest expectations!",3
GE Personal Security Door Stop Alarm,"I purchased this because I found myself staying in slightly dicey circumstances, alone for several weeks in a very large house with no nearby neighbors or working alarm system and more than 19 easily-broken-into doors and windows. After receiving it and hearing how loud it was, I also thought anyone breaking in and hearing it go off would assume there was an alarm system set, and possibly take off because of it. Not as good as a serious door lock - the kind we had in New York when I was younger, that props up against the knob and literally prevents someone from opening the door - but small enough to pack and carry with you. If you stay in a lot of hotels and are a bit nervous about your door being opened, this is a good choice. I'd give it five stars but for a few things that make it annoying for travel (which is, after all, what it's pitched for): 1. In order to get the battery out, you have to remove the non-skid bottom. That would be okay if the bottom attached with two regular screws (one top one bottom or center) so you could open them with a coin. However, the screw requires a tiny Phillips head screwdriver to get it out. So if you're traveling and want to make sure it doesn't go off in your suitcase by unplugging the battery, it's a real pain. You have to travel with a Philips head screwdriver small enough to fit the screw (Swiss army knife, for instance, is too big). If I were these folks, I'd have included a tiny Philips head that could be taped to the side of the device. 2. If you're travelling with it and don't want to remove the battery or unhook it, your only other choice is to use the ON/OFF switch, which is small and light enough to accidentally go from OFF to ON in your luggage if jarred against something. The switch should have a cover ensuring this doesn't happen (or you should carry gaffer tape and tape it to OFF before packing). 3. The above issue could potentially be avoided if they sold a well-fitting see-through case for it. The alarm comes in a No-Human-Can-Possibly-Open see-through plastic thing, I used that for packing, and put a ""Dear TSA, this is a personal travel alarm"" note with it along with visible directions. But the plastic sales case is large, difficult to open, and will crack soon. I realize I'm noting several things that, given the reasonable price and efficiency, probably won't matter to anyone - but be aware that you will need the Phillips head screwdriver to work with this.",3
Panavise 809 Camera Window Suction-Cup Mount,"This clearly is designed to be a CCTV mount. As such, with most CCTV cameras having top mounted attachment, I have no doubt that it works flawlessly.It is very well constructed and does indeed have amazing suction power and solid construction without any ""wriggles"". I bought it hoping that I could use it on the fairly steeply raked windshield of a late model Civic to film driving routes with my digital camera. Even though I have a low profile ""ultracompact"" digital camera, there was not enough room between the windshield and the mount to allow me to mount the camera - unless I mounted it upside down, which I obviously could not do because of the inability to rotate the resulting movie. FORTUNATELY I discovered that the Civic has a flat non-porous ( i.e. plastic ) top gauge cover, and was able to mount it on that. But the vast majority of cars have curved top gauge covers, so I don't think this will be suitable for any but a few car models for the purpose I'm using it for. If Panavise could come up with the same assembly and a U - shaped holder for mounting a camera with a standard tripod screw thread from the bottom, BELOW the mount - now that would be far more useful.",4
Panavise 809 Camera Window Suction-Cup Mount,"This is the big mama jama of suction cup mounts. I've only used it twice so far, but both times it is incredibly strong and doesn't let up. I can use it to pick up the steel hood of my car! ( like 28 lbs I believe). Adjustments are easy to make and stay where you've left them. Excellent suction mount, especially for the low price! (I mean... except for those complete trash suction mounts that are like 10 bucks... but please dont even try those.. they're REALLY bad) Update: I have now owned this camera for 2.5 years and damn. This thing never quits. It does appear worn, but definitely not broken. The construction is very high quality and the clamps are very well made. I have run it in salt water, fresh water, in the air, on cars, on helmets, on windows on buiildings, on the side of a bus, on the dashboard of my sand rail and untold number of other places. I wont say it's perfect, because it's not, but if you're shopping for a 100% vibration free suction cup for a small dlsr for under 30 dollars then I would suggest you look elsewhere. If you're looking for a suction cup mount that has almost never let go on me (only once... and that was because i put it on a grimy dirty piece of pot metal... which was very foolish)this is it. I left it on the side of my car going 80 mph for 4 hours and it didnt quit. It's probably good enough for your needs. I will, however, be replacing this with another of the same at the end of this year because of all the salt water use this has seen I am worried some components I cannot see are rusting away. It's just about as tight as ever, however.",4
Panavise 809 Camera Window Suction-Cup Mount,"This is a great mount, I've had this on an outside window of my house for 2 months through the winter. It was temporarily holding a camera weighing roughly 1/2 lb. I just recently removed the mount from the window and it was stuck on there very well, no chance of it falling off. The threaded mount is perfect for whatever you might want to attach to it. I have a similar designed Panavise mount for my GoPro and I stick that on the side of my truck with 100% confidence it's not going anywhere. I have also stuck these mounts to the go-kart bodies at Pole Position and never had it come off. This is a great universal mount, I highly recommend it for quick temporary mounting.",4
Panavise 809 Camera Window Suction-Cup Mount,"This is a suction cup mount for very small point and shoot cameras. It arrived in a box with a sheet of instructions. You press it against clean glass, push the air out with the PRESS button, and pull the locking lever. Then attach a camera, and that's it. I use it for a small fuji point and shoot all weather camera in my Toyota Yaris. Works as described. Pros: low cost, ease of use, versatile. Cons: short mount arm - almost impossible to use on windshields, poorly written - contradictory instructions, flexible = added camera bounce. Summary, this device is intended to be used on nearly vertical or horizontal glass, not a sloping windshield. The only way it can be used on a windshield is if the camera was upside down. It is designed to be used only with tiny lightweight digital cameras. On my car, on the windshield, when the arm is extended up for a normally positioned camera mount, there is not enough clearance between the top of the camera mounting screw and the windshield for any device. Maybe your vehicle windshield has less of an angle than my Yaris and it may work for you. And use on a door window doesn't work because there is not enough clearance to see around the roof support column to look out the windshield. It might work from a sunroof or a bathroom mirror, but only for a tiny point and shoot camera. I should try mounting it to the car hood. I did try once mounting it on the outside of the car on the windshield but feared I would earn a ticket for doing so. additional comment: After trying a few other suction cup mounts, I revert back to this one because of it's short size it adds minimal camera vibration. However, the camera you use on this must be very small because it is difficult for the camera mounting surface to give enough clearance from the mount itself to put much of anything on it. This is a great mount for the Ego digital camera. I have never had the suction cup come off even once yet.",4
"GE Personal Security Alarm Kit, Includes Deluxe Door Alarm with Keypad Activation and Window/Door Alarms, Easy Installation, DIY Home Protection, Burglar Alert, Magnetic Sensor, Off/Chime/Alarm, 51107","These have been a life saver for our 3 year old escape artist! We put these on all our outside doors so we can hear when our daughter opens the doors. We were having problems with our clever 3 year old opening doors and running outside, she can reach the locks or use chairs to get to them. She would wait until she knew were occupied and quietly let herself outside. We put the alarms up at the very tops of the doors on velcro mounts (I bought heavy duty velcro separately) so that they able to be moved around. We plan on using them in our 5th wheel trailer when we camp so we can hear her if she escapes in the middle of the night. They are VERY LOUD so we can hear them if we upstairs. If you find them too loud I would recommend putting a thick piece of clear packing tape over them to muffle the sound a little (we do this on noisy toys).",4
"GE Personal Security Alarm Kit, Includes Deluxe Door Alarm with Keypad Activation and Window/Door Alarms, Easy Installation, DIY Home Protection, Burglar Alert, Magnetic Sensor, Off/Chime/Alarm, 51107","This is very loud which is great, exactly the point and what I wanted! The problem is when two people are entering and exiting a door, you have no idea if the other person set the alarm, if they didn't, and you put code in to disarm to open door, and the door is opened..... Wow the alarm is absolutely deafening!! You have no way of knowing if it is armed or not!! It's a great door alarm, it does have a chime setting, but IMO it just sounds like a doorbell not an alarm! So I love the alarm setting and it would definitely alert you to a break in etc. but the problem is the guessing game of whether it's armed or not!! Sometimes we even forget if we armed it or not!! Very frustrating!!",4
"GE Personal Security Alarm Kit, Includes Deluxe Door Alarm with Keypad Activation and Window/Door Alarms, Easy Installation, DIY Home Protection, Burglar Alert, Magnetic Sensor, Off/Chime/Alarm, 51107","Do you want to be awoken in the dead of night when someone cracks a window? Because, my friends, these suckers are LOUD and they will tell you immediately if a door or window open more than an inch. If you have concerns about people sneaking in-or out-of your house and want a local system that will alert you to the issue, this is your best friend. The only issue I had was they stick on with 3M strips, and one of the sensors fell off a window that had old paint, so I wish there was a way to screw on the skinny side of the sensors. They are simple to install, easy to use, and the noise it makes will definitely let you know something has been opened.",4
"GE Personal Security Alarm Kit, Includes Deluxe Door Alarm with Keypad Activation and Window/Door Alarms, Easy Installation, DIY Home Protection, Burglar Alert, Magnetic Sensor, Off/Chime/Alarm, 51107","I am very pleased with this kit plus I also installed window alarms on every window additional to the kit. This comes with two door keypads you can program a code into and set to chime or alarm which is really loud. The keypad and magnet are super easy to install with double stick tape or you can do more securely with screws too. The window alarms really come in handy for me as I have an old house with a few windows that can fly open or drop down a little at the top and lose me a ton of money in heat or air conditioning, so I put these on and found where I had to drill windows shut or prop with security bars. They come with the magnets needed too on the window ones, the door alarms you do need batteries, I feel very secure combining these with my wifi video cameras (see Zmodo also here) as in case electric or wifi go out; these will still sound loud alarms they are on battery so I think its a good combo. Add the window decals and yard sign and who needs a security installer!",4
"GE Personal Security Alarm Kit, Includes Deluxe Door Alarm with Keypad Activation and Window/Door Alarms, Easy Installation, DIY Home Protection, Burglar Alert, Magnetic Sensor, Off/Chime/Alarm, 51107","Despite what the enclosed manual says, the door alarm switch has no ""off"" position in the product that we have received. In order to shut the door alarm off completely so that it makes no sound, you have to set the switch to ""Alarm"" and then use the keypad to deactivate. Surely, that is easy to do, but the manual is silent about that (because it refers to the ""off"" position in the toggle switch). Perhaps they got rid of the ""off"" position because it would otherwise be too easy for an intruder to shut the alarm off upon entry. If so, that makes sense, but either way the manual is WRONG. In addition, the design of the door alarm is such that the magnet has to be placed right by one of the slide switches on either side of the alarm. This makes the slide switch difficult to reach. Yes, you can take the unit off from the mounting to do the same thing, but why so much work just to slide a switch? To the contrary, the window alarm units are a cinch. I am giving this product a 3-star rating only because the window units are good. Updated 8/5/2014 Downgraded to 2 stars due to the door alarm's not responding to our keypad code to shut it off. We have now taken it down.",4
"GE Personal Security Alarm Kit, Includes Deluxe Door Alarm with Keypad Activation and Window/Door Alarms, Easy Installation, DIY Home Protection, Burglar Alert, Magnetic Sensor, Off/Chime/Alarm, 51107","This is a great buy and I am impressed by the intensity and volume of the alarm. We had an intruder in our back yard and prior to the police arriving he was tapping on my daughters window. She became scared of her room because she worried someone might be able to open her window. We talked with her about what might help her feel safe. One thing she suggested was an alarm that would sound if someone tried to open the window. I started looking for window alarms and found this package. For three window alarms this package was very reasonably priced the bonus is the included door alarm that has a code to disarm. When the package arrived we tried out the alarms, the chime is very loud and simply signals once that the door has been opened. We can hear the chime from any room in the house if the windows are opened. In the alarm setting there is a constant alarm until the window is closed. It is very loud and can even be heard by our neighbors (all of the plots in our neighborhood are about an acre so it is impressive that the neighbors can hear it). We do have attentive neighbors and they will call the police and investigate if they here an alarm. Though this is not a monitored alarm system (we live in a very rural area where there aren't many options on monitored systems and the ones available simply alert the police and unfortunately a call from an alarm company does not rank as a high priority call, though a call from a home owner that there is a trespasser will bring a very fast response.) the alarm is loud enough that it should scare off an intruder. If you are only looking for something that will quietly chime to notify you that a door or window has opened this will be too loud for you.",4
Replacement Remotes,FIND THE RE PROGRAM BUTTON BEFORE YOU BUY!!!! I bought this because the buttons on my old remote weren't responding. I bought batteries and that wasn't it. I guess after 5 years of pressing the same button it retires. This comes with the instructions and works just like the original. Find the button on your vehicle so to can program it and no more waking up to start your ride on those cold days! Aaaah warm truck on cold mornings :D,5
Replacement Remotes,Just used the shell and buttons to refurbish my current after market remote starter! Works great!,5
Replacement Remotes,"Bought a used vehicle that had a remote start in it but not the remote, it worked perfectly and was fairly easy to program to the existing system. Feels well made,Great price, very happy with it.",5
Replacement Remotes,Works perfectly. Programmed myself.,5
Replacement Remotes,Thanks,5
Replacement Remotes,Bought this after my original (after market) remote starter broke for my 2003 car. I did not want to spend the $$ on a new remote for such an old car. Luckily for me- the remote was easy to program and works great!! I have had it now for 4 months with no problems! Works the same as the original. I would recommend it to anyone. Just make sure that it is the correct model:-),5
Replacement Remotes,worked great and was delivered quickly,5
Replacement Remotes,Took the remote to a Car Alarm place and he was able to program it in less than 2 minutes to the truck.... Its exactly what I needed!,5
Heavy-duty Adjustable Pinswitch,"The pinswitch is a nice and easy switch that can be used for many applications. I used for underhood lighting and was happy when the item came and it included five switches (I was only expecting one). They are adjustable for your application and could be easily used for a door, trunk, tailgate, hood or even if you wanted to add lights to a toolbox in your trunkbed or behind seats. Appears to be nicely made and should last for a while. And I liked that it also included the terminal for the wire which is the standard size if you wanted to replace it with an angled one or connect to an existing wire without having to cut it and put a new one on.",4
Heavy-duty Adjustable Pinswitch,I guess if you need it I'm sure it works fine.. I paid my buddy to install my remote start and he said these things are more of a hassle than anything else. He never ended up using it.. and I think my system may have even come with one... If you wanna do it by the books get one. But apparently these aren't necessary.,4
Heavy-duty Adjustable Pinswitch,"Quality seems sufficient. You get 5. Photo is black and white. The part is yellow zinc. Usually an indication of hardened metal, but I didn't exactly try to ruin one. My coworkers seem awfully impressed with my 98 Honda Accord hood lamp. Yes, the push pin is plastic for obvious functionality reasons, but I haven't seen it demonstrate any issues after it being installed for quite a while.",4
Heavy-duty Adjustable Pinswitch,Works as advertised. Used it to activate a light in the engine bay once the hood is opened. Not sure if the quality is good enough to use for passenger doors being opened and closed with significantly more cycling/abuse.,4
Heavy-duty Adjustable Pinswitch,"Very cheaply made product. Broke after just a couple of uses. I originally purchased a couple of these, they all broke after a short period of use. I would suggest looking for a better product.",4
Heavy-duty Adjustable Pinswitch,These pinswitches are great quality. I used them to install lights under the hood on my truck... I wanted the lights to turn on automatically when I opened the hood... this did the trick,4
Heavy-duty Adjustable Pinswitch,"Used it along with some led strip lights to create this simple system. When I open the hood, the lights comes on, when I close it they go out by separating the ground connection. I will put this in my two other cars!",4
Heavy-duty Adjustable Pinswitch,So far so good. Replaced a broken pin-switch. We'll see how long this one lasts.,4
Directed Install essentials Dual Zone Motion Sensor 508d,Awsome product. Works great with the viper 5706v. Literally plug and play. Still trying to get that perfect adjustment for sensetivity.perfect for jeep when you have the doors off. Might do a video.,4
Directed Install essentials Dual Zone Motion Sensor 508d,"This is a must for any alarm system. Just the shock sensor alone won't give much protection. This way if someone is too nosy around your car it will do a few warning beeps and if they stay there the full alarm will go off. But it has to be adjusted correctly! Two things to remember when adjusting: 1. It takes 20-30 seconds to fully arm and expand the radar circle. So don't just arm and step right up to the car, wait until it's fully armed and then test the sensitivity. 2. After the warning has been triggered a few times, most DEI alarm systems lower the sensitivity to prevent false alarms. This makes adjusting nearly impossible. To ""reset"" the sensitivity, just turn the ignition on and off after every time you adjust the sensor. Just keep those two things in mind because they're not mentioned in the manual. Other than that just follow the manual and you'll be good.",4
Directed Install essentials Dual Zone Motion Sensor 508d,"When it rains it pours .... First of all, rain started setting it off. Then the birds that land on my fiberglass camper started setting it off. This is a really rank amateur attempt of electronically monitoring a vehicle, there are just too many environmental issues that trigger these things. Wish I'd discovered this prior to buying 3 of them for my camper and after the return window closed. Thinking hard, it might serve someone who always parks in a parking garage where there is no rain or snow and not many birds that land on the vehicle.",4
Directed Install essentials Dual Zone Motion Sensor 508d,"Great addition to your alarm. I installed it under the plastic next to the stick shift, between the two front sits. It works as a charm. Very useful to protect the car detonating the warning or full alarm before getting broken the window door. It has been working now for several years. When leaving the doors open (e.g. at the beach while getting stuff from the car) the ""safe"" areas grow limiting people even more from approaching to the open doors.",4
Directed Install essentials Dual Zone Motion Sensor 508d,"Does what it's supposed to do. My only complaint is that the ""field"" this unit puts out is a little out of shape, yes even after adjusting. It seems to put out more of a ""field"" to the right hand side no matter how you adjust it. It does however work just like it's supposed to.",4
Directed Install essentials Dual Zone Motion Sensor 508d,A must need if you don't want people touching your vehicle while it is armed. Yes you may need to tweak the zoning. Which takes about ten minutes. You will not be let down.,4
Directed Install essentials Dual Zone Motion Sensor 508d,Works exactly as advertised! Great when installed correctly!,4
Directed Install essentials Dual Zone Motion Sensor 508d,It works as advertised the sensitivity can be adjusted and it is easy to use. Works well connected to Viper 350 3105 Model. Plugs right in and works,4
Directed Electronics 506T I.T. Audio Sensor,"For DEI alarms, this sensor is plug-n-play. The sensor comes with 2 major components, the audio sensor microphone and the sensor electronics box. The sensor adjustment is done via rotary knob on the electronics box, and there is a red LED for feedback during adjustment. For DEI alarms, the sensor port accepts the harness that is provided in this kit, along with instructions. To test, I would recommend having all windows rolled-up and using a set of car keys to jingle against the exterior of the window. The microphone can be mounted in two different ways. You can drill a 1/2"" hole and push the sensor microphone through. Or you can use the provided bracket with 3M 2-way tape. I chose this sensor over the 508D (Field Disturbance) because I am afraid of the large amounts of Hilo rain that we get here (that may cause false trips of the alarm). ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ October 8, 2015 Update I finally got around to installing this sensor (along with the 507M Tilt Sensor). I spliced the two sensor harnesses together, with diode isolation. Both of these sensors (506 and 507M) go into the Sensor 2 port. I tested each sensor individually, and they both work and trigger the Sensor 2 on my alarm. The only dilemma is not sure what to call Sensor 2 on my remote (if this zone is triggered, you can have the 2-way remote say Glass Breakage or Tilt). I drilled a 1/2"" hole, which may be a tad bit too big for this sensor (I didn't like the cheesy microphone mount that comes with this). Maybe if you can find a 15/32"" drill bit?",4
Directed Electronics 506T I.T. Audio Sensor,"This is a great little sensor. If you're going to bother installing an alarm you might as well add this audio glass break sensor for a few bucks more. It is super simple to install and also very easy to adjust. the sensitivity with just the twist of a knob/screw. It works perfect with DEI alarms like the Viper or Clifford line. I picked one up for my Viper and for a few dollars I have a bit more security. If someone breaks your window, pops the hood, and cuts your power or siren wire then you're out of luck. It's just too easy to do. Shock sensors may or may not pick up the window breaking depending on how its done so this is a little extra insurance. It can zip tie to about anything during installation as it is very small and light weight.",4
Directed Electronics 506T I.T. Audio Sensor,"I bought this audio sensor as an added layer of protection for my car. I wasn't sure if it would really live up to its description but I was willing to give it a try. I am glad that I did as it really does add another layer of security. What's great is that you can adjust the sensitivity of the microphone to suit your needs. I live in a highly populated city, so it took some time to find the right balance. Now it works perfectly and it will even give warning chirps if I accidentally tap my keys against the window but not go off when someone drive by with their speakers at max volume. Strongly recommend, especially if you have items you want to protect from 'smash and grab' break-ins.",4

Directed Electronics 506T I.T. Audio Sensor,works great.,4
Directed Electronics 506T I.T. Audio Sensor,"I installed this sensor's mic on the middle upside of the rear glass of my Corolla with the supplied 2 sided tape. The receiver at the trunk so it could be visible when it's opened and therefore easier to calibrate. The microphone picks sounds of highwave frequencies and triggers (-) into the blue wire (you can try hitting a glass bottle with some metal). it's simple, all the work I've to do was running a blue cable from the dash to the trunk. I just installed at back because thieves tend to break the rear door little triangle glass, instead of the larger door glasses, this works for them in many cases without triggering the full alarm, because shock sensor don't always pick 'shocks' from the back of the car when pressed toward using force on the door. Don't spec to see a big glass to be broken!! that will make a lot of noise and vibration to the car, so alarm with be on!!! only desperate theft fall in this category. I recommend this item, it offers more security to your car and all your valued items inside.",4
Directed Electronics 506T I.T. Audio Sensor,The 506T Audio sensor is an optional sensor i installed for added protection with my compustar alarm. It is used to detect the sound of breaking glass. It was installed in a Cadillac Escalade. The installation was straightforward but i did need to purchase a longer rca cable. I got one from radio shack. I mounted mine on the windshield behind the rear view mirror with the microphone facing the dashboard. The sensor is extremely accurate and can be adjusted to your liking. It can be tested by tapping keys on various windows outside of the car. When it can pick up the keys on the farthest window (usually the rear) you know it has been set properly. It has been working flawlessly for years and luckily no one has broken my windows (knock on wood). If you have an alarm that accepts optional sensors this is a no brainer.,4
Midland AVPH3 Transparent Security Headsets with PTT/VOX - Pair,"I do some work for clients that require the use of radios and I was REALLY tired of trying to listen to the squawk of a handset in a crowd of people. I equally disliked having other's conversions being broadcast out to anyone in the area. Then I came across these beauties. I think the part I like the most is the audio clarity. Since the ear piece sits inside the ear canal I can leave the volume turned down (less distortion) and the outside noise is somewhat blocked so I can now hear MUCH clearer. Night and day difference. Not only that but I'm no longer a roaming broadcast station for everyone else's messages. It' also nice not to have to keep the radio in my hand, I keep the push to talk clipped to my lanyard or shirt and I'm good to go. Slight annoyance, the PTT cord is too short. What I really wanted was to run the PTT mic out my sleeve but it's a foot or more too short. I currently clip it to my shirt collar or lanyard and that works pretty well. Hidden bonus. If you walk out of the function, say to grab a bite to eat, and you forget that you have the ear piece in (yeah, it's that comfortable), you tend to get the STRANGEST looks from people. Do this while wearing a dark suite and you'll discover that it creates a ""bubble"" of open space around you as people will steer clear of you.",4
Midland AVPH3 Transparent Security Headsets with PTT/VOX - Pair,"These work well. The only thing to note is that if you're using these with VOX (voice activated), the FRS radios themselves take a half second to recognize that your'e talking, so it often clips off the first word you say. We got in the habit of starting every sentence with ""OK ..."" to get around that. This isn't a fault of the ear pieces.",4
Midland AVPH3 Transparent Security Headsets with PTT/VOX - Pair,"These work great for the price point and are fairly discreet. The only complaint I have is with the mic. This piece is made so that you can run it down your sleeve and clip the mic to your cuff. However, it could use another inch or two of length in the cable. The shorter cable limits my options on how to run it. For example, I am not able to run the cable behind my shoulders and down my sleeve due to it being too short. I have to run it down the front of my chest and down my sleeve. Even then, it just barely reaches, so anytime I reach out for something or raise my hands, it pulls my sleeve back. Having to run it this way also makes the clear cord hang forward toward my chest instead of straight down or back along my neck. This makes it more noticeable in my opinion. Other than the short cord, this is a very good headset for the price.",4
Midland AVPH3 Transparent Security Headsets with PTT/VOX - Pair,"Ok, that title must sound weird. But this headset, for some ungodly reason, hates the left ear. I read it in a previous review as well. I use this for my job working at a private school as the student activities coordinator. (Yeah, my job rocks, I know.) It was either this headset, or one of the many headsets that have a boom microphone in front of my mouth that makes me look like a member of the Backstreet Boys. Considering I work with middle schoolers, this is clearly not an option if I want to retain any sense of credibility. I bought this pair of headsets and the sound quality is awesome, I can hear other teaches and administrative staff communicate with me clear as day. The microphone gets clipped not up my sleeve but instead just below my neck on the collar of my shirt. The mic is powerful enough to pick up my voice without me having to bend my head down to speak into it. AWESOME. The only downside is this headset sucks in my left ear. It just won't stay in. Do I have a weird shaped left ear? I'm open to the possibility. But for some reason it will only stay put in my right. That is my only concern and it truly is low on the list of things I would deem important. Good quality headset and a steal at this price. Get it, you'll be happy in your right ear.",4
Midland AVPH3 Transparent Security Headsets with PTT/VOX - Pair,"The first set didn't work. Well, the first one out of the package didn't work and I didn't bother trying the other one because why pay for only one working headset? Amazon was prompt with the replacement and, ever since, I have used these headsets under conditions that most people won't encounter (wide temperature swings, chemical exposure, high humidity, very loud ambient noise, all kinds of radios that support the plug configuration) and they work like a champ. The VOX feature is nice, but it will get you into trouble. It's sensitive enough to pick-up what other people around you are saying. Oops. So far, the PTT switch has held up under really abusive conditions. Time will tell how long it lasts.",4
Midland AVPH3 Transparent Security Headsets with PTT/VOX - Pair,"These are working well with Midland radios. We use them mainly in manual PTT mode. Our use is staying in touch while kayaking, hiking or birding. Moderate use and lots of outdoors, they are holding up well and are a good value at $10 a unit. My wife likes the fit as is. I trimmed the ear loop down about 1/4 or 3/8 inch to reduce the 'springing' I felt in the ear bud. Easy to do and feels better to me.",4
Linear Act-31B 1-Channel Keychain Transmitter,"I have had this about a year now. I have a detached garage with multiple garage doors. Some doors we have a external keypad for external entry. the bay that housed my car did not. I used to carry the 3 door remote that came with it in/out of the house with me every day. This guy has worked great. Works probably 20 feet from the Opener which is as good if not better than the original/primary remote in the car. It was easy to program, once I remembered how. There wasn't really any instructions that came with it, but my ""Linear"" garage door opener, has a sync/learning button that you press and then it ""watches"" for a signal from the remote and voila! It is paired and ready to go. I was originally planning a Raspberry Pi project so that I could open any of my garage doors from my phone, but this was by far cheaper and well worth the $15 I paid.",4
Linear Act-31B 1-Channel Keychain Transmitter,"Very simple to set up, I pushed the ""learn"" button on the side of the garage door opener, pressed the button on the transmitter, and it paired instantly. One push of the button from just about any angle and the door opens, which is nice as I use this for my motorcycle key and it would be awkward if I had to point it at the door to open it.",4
Linear Act-31B 1-Channel Keychain Transmitter,"I was hesitant to get this remote as I do have one for my car that works okay (ish). I am very happy that I splurged and bought this. It was very easy to setup and SO much better than my old one. I can click the darn button and the garage door opens, first time. My other one had three buttons, and often the door would stop halfway and it was just a pain! I'm very very thrilled with this (yeah yeah, small things excite me). I highly recommend this! Worth every penny.",4
Linear Act-31B 1-Channel Keychain Transmitter,We bought this garage door opener for my husband to use. His car stays outside the garage and he didn't like leaving the opener in the car. This opener was very easy to program and it works great every time. We have no complaints on this product at all. It is well made and very reasonably priced.,4
Linear Act-31B 1-Channel Keychain Transmitter,"I can't figure out how to program it. The instructions say follow the instructions on the transmitter however, there are no instructions on the transmitter. Inside the remote there are no pins to match to the transmitter...Can someone tell me how to program it to my buildings garage door? :-( Thanks, otherwise I will have to send it back :-(",4
Linear Act-31B 1-Channel Keychain Transmitter,This is not an effective remote. For some reason I thought it was going to work a lot better than it does. The signal can't penetrate my garage door from distance which kind of defeats the purpose. I would stay away.,4

MORNING INDUSTRY RF-01P Remote Control Electronic Dead Bolt (Polished Brass/Black),"Just installed mine a couple weeks ago, and already one of my favorite bits of tech here. It's on the door to my garage, and sure beats the heck out of going out in the snow to see if I remembered to lock up. Just push the lock button, and as long as the red light flashes, it's either locking, or is already locked. Only real complaint might be the green light is pretty dim. That was in the wrong hole when I got it - maybe I just didn't push it in far enough when putting it where it belonged. Also wouldn't mind a couple more mounting screws to beef up the inside backing plate behind the battery compartment. As is, I can see where the lock mechanism could drift over time, throwing off the alignment and interfering with proper operation. One thing I'd really like to see is a larger indoor control box. Right now, I've got one of the keyfobs velcro'd to a wall. I can see the lock and lights on it from where I mounted the control, but it's kind of a klutz job.

Directed Electronics 507M Tilt Sensor,"I am giving it 4 stars since DEI still provides the wrong end connector with this kit. There is a smaller 3-pin connector on the end of the harness that goes to your alarm system. I am unsure if non-DEI alarms utilize this 3-pin connector or not, but I do know DEI alarms DO NOT! The instructions indicate which wires go where on your alarm system. DEI should just provide flying leads at the end of the sensor harness. This 3-pin connector is causing a lot of uncertainty and questions arise on how to plug this into their DEI alarm. The stock photo that Amazon utilizes is not the current 507M tilt sensor. The stock photo is of the older DEI tilt motion sensor (10+ years ago). The updated sensor is smaller than the older version. This sensor comes with a small screw, double-stick tape, and instructions. I will be installing this sensor within the coming month, where I will add an update to this review. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ October 8, 2015 Update I finally got around to installing this into my 1996 Infiniti I30, along with the 506T Audio Sensor. I spliced two of these into the same harness (that eventually goes into the Sensor 2 port of my 5706 alarm), however, the ground connection for this 507M sensor needs to go to the orange wire (Ground When Armed). Each time the alarm is armed, the 507M will re-calibrate itself each time. So far, I am using both default setting on this sensor (1degree sensitivity and 10second delay). I tested this with the remote start of the car, and luckily the 1degree threshold doesn't seem too sensitive.",4

Honeywell Ademco 6150 Fixed English Display Keypad,"Replaced a 20-year old Ademco 6128 which had stuck keys. It took all of 15 minutes. All you have to do is cut off power to your system (find the plug and unplug it, and remove the terminals from the internal battery). Then, it is a matter of hooking up 4 wires. These are extremely thin wires so it takes some care to get them installed into the terminals and the screws tightened down very fully. No need to reprogram anything. There are good videos on the Web showing most of the process. When you turn the system back on, key in your code, and then ""off"", twice. Also a good idea to call your alarm company beforehand and tell them you are going to have a power interruption for about a half hour.",4
Honeywell Ademco 6150 Fixed English Display Keypad,"It works as it should. I have to replace this exact Honeywell 6150 keypad because the buttons were sticking. After much online research, here's how I did it and it worked just fine. Hopefully It should work as well for you: 1. With the old one disarmed but plugged in, press the 1 & 3 keys simultaneously until a number appears on the display, the address code. It will be anywhere from 00 to 31. The number is important later 2. Use the notches on the bottom (insert a screwdriver to release the latches). 3. Remove the front panel (the wall bracket can stay, since the new front panel will match it perfectly) and then remove the four thin wires, noting which terminal they were screwed into, making sure they do not touch each other, and removing the black wire LAST. 4. Attach the wires to the same terminals on the new panel in the same places, again with the black lead LAST. It will chime and light up. 5. Press the 1 & 3 buttons simultaneously. If the number on the display matches the number on the panel you had removed, the unit will work. If it is not the same number, use the new keypad buttons to replace the number with the proper number from the old keypad. 6. You are free to press the * key next to exit this mode, and then use the master code for the system to test it. It should work and continue to do so.",4

He ordered two Honeywell, Ademco 6150 keypads to replace our old ones. Also, the best price we found was through Amazon. The directions were very easy to understand. Within one hour he, replaced and installed both of our 26 year old Honeywell keypads. The new keypads are much larger than our previous ones; and much easier to read numbers and words in the dark, due to the sufficient amount of lighting. It has been two months since the installation of the Admeco Keypads, and suffice it to say we are exceptionally happy with this product. We say, “IGNORE” all negative reviews, because we find this product to be outstanding.",4
Honeywell Ademco 6150 Fixed English Display Keypad,"I read these really long reviews about programing and was a bit overwhelmed. Imagine my surprise when I unscrewd my old key pad and all there was were 4 wires to plug in. What are those other guys talking about? My old key pad was 20 years old and Ademco, the numbers were sticky. This new one was easy to install and works fine. It's no frills but works.",4
Heath Zenith SL-7368-02 Wireless Entry Alert Chime,"This worked about 10% of the time. Installed, worked for one night. Would not work again. Tested, battery died. (battery died less than a month after ordering unit), replaced battery, worked for a few hours then nothing...again. As an electrician, this is a quick easy install, should work with limited issues. Not the case. Tried multiple configurations, making sure the sensor was making contact, tried multiple locations for the receiver to make sure distance wasn't an issue. Could not get reliable use. Unfortunately, the window for return has closed so I am stuck with a useless piece of equipment and have to now order something else.",4
Heath Zenith SL-7368-02 Wireless Entry Alert Chime,"This works as described, I was looking for something easy to install. Which means no wiring. The sensors were easy to attach to the door and chime plugs directly into an outlet. The only thing I wish it did was chimed louder. In all fairness I placed the chimer in another room so I can hear it throughout the office, it chimes great if you are in the same room. But with ac going and people talking it does get muffled some by the other noises.",4
Heath Zenith SL-7368-02 Wireless Entry Alert Chime,"The main unit plugs into a simple outlet with no fuss. You will probably take an entire outlet due to its size, so be prepared. The smaller unit and magnet trigger are of decent quality. The plastic door is a little awkward to get into, I received a few nasty cuts from it while trying to set up the battery. The real downer was the ""tape"" included with the magnet and companion smaller piece. It is not quality sticky tape. They strongly urge you to drill into wood to make this work properly, but I have a metal door in my office. After a month, one of the sides ripped off from the ""tape,"" forcing me to buy a second full unit to replace a simple part. If you do buy this, make sure you get 3M mounting tape with it for a more secure stick. Overall, it is a good product (even with the bad tape), and I will purchase again if I move to a different office or I am in need of a notification system like this.",4
Heath Zenith SL-7368-02 Wireless Entry Alert Chime,"Purchased for a business, completely solved the annoying buzzer problem. Husband loves that the chime can be placed in a different location than the door it's attached to!",4
Heath Zenith SL-7368-02 Wireless Entry Alert Chime,"I easily installed this item. The plastic packing is minimal and conservative. Once opened, there are the main components and a set of screws and a spacer piece. I didn't need either. I just plugged in the receiver and double-sided taped the two magnetic pieces to my screen door top. I tested it twice and it's great!! As soon as the door is open, the alarm (an 8 chime Westminster note) sounds. The volume is controllable with a simple screwdriver on the back of the plug unit. Not to worry, the plug can reach far away. Rooms away without any wires. That's right: NO WIRES. Can't beat this. I tried to find this at a local hardware store and they never heard of such an item. Strange. Anyway, this is a great item that I can now sleep peacefully with the back door open to cool the home at night and know if something happens, I'll know about it with a nice ""chime"". Cheers!!",4
Heath Zenith SL-7368-02 Wireless Entry Alert Chime,"Bought this to replace an earlier (pre-Zenith) version that I had inadvertently damaged. My original ""Heath"" unit worked just fine. The 'improved' electronics in this new Zenith-influenced unit appear to be much more location sensitive: I spent half the day trying to find someplace where the receiver would work at all - and even then 'sporadically' at best. I'm happy for those 106 who people had better luck with this unit than I did , but I find myself more aligned with those 106 other people, who demonstrated their disappointment by giving this product a less-than-4-Star rating.",4
Heath Zenith SL-7368-02 Wireless Entry Alert Chime,We use this in our office so we can hear clients entering our (blind) front entryway. You need to change a jumper setting in the door module to get it to do a single chime but it works quite well. The base (noise maker) must be plugged into a power supply (like a wall socket). We placed ours at the end of the extension cord inside a file cabinet to dampen the sound (there is a volume control) yet stay close enough (50') to the door transponder. Works great.,4
Heath Zenith SL-7368-02 Wireless Entry Alert Chime,"I have two, one for the front door and one for the back doors of the office. When we are all sitting in the employee break room, we can tell which door someone is entering because you can set two different tones for each door. Easy setup also.",4
"VideoSecu 1/4"" x 20 Threads Swivel Security Camera Mount 2-6 Inch Adjustable Universal Pan Tilt CCTV Camera Mounting Bracket with Ceiling Clip 1BO",Great mount. Was very disappointing when it showed up because I didn't think the balljoint would tighten at all. Turns out the actual screw twist popping out on the side is only for letting the mount end slide left and right parallel to a wall. There is a little female nut on the opposite side that needs a hexagon shaped screwdriver tool to actually tighten the ball joint into place. The whole mount and the Oculus Sensor are soo light that I mounted it with 3 thumbtacks in each hole and its holding super sturdy! The ball joint is holding very sturdy as well after using an allen wrench to tighten it.,3
"VideoSecu 1/4"" x 20 Threads Swivel Security Camera Mount 2-6 Inch Adjustable Universal Pan Tilt CCTV Camera Mounting Bracket with Ceiling Clip 1BO","I bought 5 of these and put them together to make one long ceiling mount for my mini projector. Cheap enough that it cost me $40 total, so still worth it to me. I needed the extra length to extend the projector down past my ceiling fan. Easy to install, no problems with holding a mini projector, no issues with pointing/positioning/angling the projector.",3
"VideoSecu 1/4"" x 20 Threads Swivel Security Camera Mount 2-6 Inch Adjustable Universal Pan Tilt CCTV Camera Mounting Bracket with Ceiling Clip 1BO","Well I paid $7 for this at the time of this review. I don't know if the price has changed by the time you read this, but if it has gone up then I would deduct more stars. I have to say that I like the kit and all the pieces that come with it. It does allow for a ton of versatility in mounting. I am using it for a pico-projector upside down. I used the 3 screw round mounting base to install it on the underside of an overhead compartment in an RV. That part was easy. The base is solid enough. The problem I ran into was the swivel mount. The side knob does tighten the ball into the socket and does an ok job. The threads on the screw knob are not machined very precisely and it is a little bit hard to turn and to know when it has become tight enough. Also there is an allen screw near the knob that has to be tightened to stop the rotating of the whole ball-socket assembly on the base. The kit did not come with a small allen wrench and none of my standard sizes fit it. It must be metric. I was able to tighten it some, but not enough to be secure. So overall it is very hard to tighten everything down with any type of precision (which is very important for a projector to get the image straight on the screen). This is a cheap mount and it works well enough for mounting things that don't have to be precision aligned. But for anything else this is not quality enough.",3
"VideoSecu 1/4"" x 20 Threads Swivel Security Camera Mount 2-6 Inch Adjustable Universal Pan Tilt CCTV Camera Mounting Bracket with Ceiling Clip 1BO","I'm a night owl, but wife is a morning person. My MacGyver-worthy solution when we are binge watching shows is a VisualGreat GP80 mini-projector and an Apple TV. The problem is that the old projector we used was a tiny 3M/Roku unit that we could velcro to the head board and the VisualGreat was too large to mount using the same strategy. I bought this VideoSecu mount to see if it could be mounted on the wall above the headboard and with a little work, was able to get it to work flawlessly.",3
"VideoSecu 1/4"" x 20 Threads Swivel Security Camera Mount 2-6 Inch Adjustable Universal Pan Tilt CCTV Camera Mounting Bracket with Ceiling Clip 1BO","Lots of options with various length pieces. All threads were well cut, no flash or obstruction, pieces went together easily and stayed that way. Purchased these knowing others used them for Oculus Rift sensors (which is what I was looking for). Also pleased the wall anchors and screws were included. The Rift sensors can be moved pretty easily if their cords are tugged at all. I'd recommend putting a loop in your cable and zip tie it to the mount. This prevents that from happening. Overall a cheap easy and effective way to get your Rift sensors off the desk and floor.",3
"VideoSecu 1/4"" x 20 Threads Swivel Security Camera Mount 2-6 Inch Adjustable Universal Pan Tilt CCTV Camera Mounting Bracket with Ceiling Clip 1BO","This broke the first time I used it. It appears to be made of cheap pot metal and the welds are very poor quality. Mine broke where the screw stud comes out of the round base. The weld that holds that stud on there broke, so the stud just spins now. Totally useless, now, for my wall application.",3
"VideoSecu 1/4"" x 20 Threads Swivel Security Camera Mount 2-6 Inch Adjustable Universal Pan Tilt CCTV Camera Mounting Bracket with Ceiling Clip 1BO","There are several comments relating to the difficulty adjusting the ball joint. I used this with an Arlo camera, which is pretty light weight, so I was able to make it work. I have noticed that the ball joint has some positions it ""wants"" to go to, and some it really doesn't like. You might set it and one spot and really have to crank on it to get it to hold still, and then rotate it a few degrees up and it sticks just fine. I very much liked the way you can mix the various parts to get things to be the right size for a particular application. In the end, I thought this was a very good product for the money - because it cost very little money - I would only caution buyers to not expect it to work very well with anything but very light weight items.",3
"VideoSecu 1/4"" x 20 Threads Swivel Security Camera Mount 2-6 Inch Adjustable Universal Pan Tilt CCTV Camera Mounting Bracket with Ceiling Clip 1BO","It's not bad. it does as you'd expect something like this to function, however the ball swivel is very grainy, like it almost feels like there's grit or something between the ball and the plastic around it. I took mine apart and re-assembled to double check, and it's almost like it's built slightly out of spec. It still works just fine, just has to be very careful when it comes to tightening down the thumb screw since it just can't seem to get tight enough around the ball.",3
Wireless Color Spy Video Camera Complete Package,"I gave it a good shot, I tried with it for several hours to try to make it work properly, but it was to no avail. I used the provided power supplies and wireless adapter that it came with along with every combination of dip-switch settings on the camera and possible position of the knob on the receiver with nothing better than a very irritating noise from the audio and an extremely choppy and unable to be made out image from the video - this was at only 24 feet away with no obstructions. Then I tried even closer (see the posted video) at less than 7 feet with no obstructions and still had a terrible picture and sound. I am an avid technology geek and DIYer and I can usually get anything to work, so if I can't make it do what I want, it will surely disappoint you. I'd advise to all others to find an alternative as I will be doing the same.",3
Wireless Color Spy Video Camera Complete Package,I cant believe some of these reviews.For $25 it is a steal!I was using an XM(not serius XM) the old accessory company.This camera is great!The camera has a tiny stand.I can see my two cars that are about 50 feet from a street light.My old XM had a poor unstable Pix.This one is rock solid-in color and almost 100 feet away.I hooked up 2 receivers.That was also great. Now if we can change the freq of the cameras we could switch from one to the other with the control on the receiver. The drawback:who makes it and where are they? China I am sure. You get a camera - a receiver - a cable and two power supplies.,3
Wireless Color Spy Video Camera Complete Package,"After reading the reviews, I was hesitant to purchase this camera. Despite most of the negative reviews that I read, I grew a pair and decided to give it a shot. Turns out the reviews were wrong. The camera is very tiny and discrete. The camera can be wireless by using a 9 volt battery or you can plug it into the outlet with the provided power cord. The set up of the camera, receiver, and video was simple and quick. Less than 3 minutes. The quality of the picture was surprisingly well for it only being a $30 camera. The distance from the camera to the receiver is pretty good. I have not tested long distances, but the two i did test, worked perfectly both times after adjusting the frequency knob. The only negative thing i could say about this camera is that the picture is not as great at night, but I expected that. I am debating on whether to buy another one in the next few days, that is how much i was impressed by it.",3
Wireless Color Spy Video Camera Complete Package,WELL I CAN'T GET NO ONE TO TELL ME WHAT THE 9 VOLT CONNECTION CLIP IS. AS I DIDN'T GET ONE BUT NEED ONE. NO ONE SEAMS TO KNOW WHAT THE 9 VOLT CONNECTION IS I ORDERED 2.1x5.5mm Male DC Power Plug BUT THAT WANT WORK.,3
Wireless Color Spy Video Camera Complete Package,This came with 2 of the same cords in it. It was suppose to have 2 different ones. But Amazon was right on top of it!! Made things right immediately.,3
Wireless Color Spy Video Camera Complete Package,"The picture is good, but there is NO audio out on the receiver and no 9v power supply. Also the tuning knob is really a 4 button channel selector. And why did they ship it with 3 nine-volt connectors and no AC adapter? But hey, its amazing it works at all for this price. And the receiver DOES work with a 9-v battery as does the camera. I was able to get a decent picture more than 20 feet away behind a wall, more clear in the center than the edges, as long as it has adequate lighting. I plan to use it for impromptu audience interviews and already have a wireless microphone I can tape this thing to, so it will do for now. Pro-grade wireless cameras or bluetooth streamers sell for 10-x as much, so until prices drop, this is an OK product.",3
Wireless Color Spy Video Camera Complete Package,"The picture is nice and sharp but it does flicker often. It flickers enough to make it not worth it for me. I have another one which is not 2g, it is 10 years old yet has a perfect and stable image at twice the distance as this one. Both receivers are the same too.",3
Wireless Color Spy Video Camera Complete Package,The range and signal quality are well below claims and expectation. Even at 10 feet the picture signal is very noisy and drops off through one wall and 30 feet to useless. The sound pickup of the Mic in a quiet room at 10 feet was very muffled sounding. Plus no documentation of any kind which means you have play with dip switches randomly and try to figure out what they do.,3
PYLE PLCM22IR Flush Mount Rear View Camera with 0.5 Lux Night Vision,"I purchased this camera intending to put this on the front or rear of my car for an in-cab DVR. Therefore; I was intending to make adjustments to the camera if I needed to so I was planning on opening the case if I had to. What I found when I received the camera was a pit-specked lens. I tried to wipe what I thought was dust off of the lens but I found the pits to be inside - So I took the camera apart and what I found was that the rear of the camera is probably more water-proof than the front lens portion. I uploaded several images one showing the front O-ring is too big for the groove where it is supposed to sit (the picture with the yellow arrow). One side of the ring is supposed to sit in the O-ring groove and the other against the outer lens glass. When I opened the camera I have, the O-ring was pinched and hanging over the groove and potentially susceptible to leaking. Since I had not mounted the camera yet, obviously I fixed the O-ring problem. Also, since I decided to mount this camera on the front, I disconnected the IR LED's. Applying this observation may lead to the conclusion that a portion of these cameras will get water inside them because of incorrect O-ring sizing. If a water-proof camera is important to you you should check yours. Other than that the camera works and seems to have a very good picture - BTW: I polished the front window glass on mine and was able to remove almost all of the pits. Maybe these should be sold as ""camera kits"".",2
PYLE PLCM22IR Flush Mount Rear View Camera with 0.5 Lux Night Vision,"This is a decent little camera, especially considering the price. My one complain is that I wish it did not have the IR LEDs. As soon as the outer lens gets any kind of dust or salt film on it (which on my bumper, means constantly) the film reflects the IR light back into the camera and makes it pretty much useless. Otherwise, I am perfectly satisfied with it. -------------------------------------------------------------- Updated March 22: I have gone through two of these cameras and neither one lasted much more than a month before it leaked and failed. They both stopped working all at once after a rainy day and upon inspection, were full of mist on the inside of the glass. I don't know what good this camera is if it can't hold up to a little rain. When the first one failed, I replaced it with the same, thinking it was just a fluke, and reinstallation would be easier with the same model. Now that the second one has failed, I am replacing it with a different model, but it is almost impossible to find another model of camera that fits the same hole. All of the other cameras out there are smaller. I will now have to repair a large hole in my bumper, just so that I can install a smaller camera into a smaller hole. Definitely would not recommend this product.",2
PYLE PLCM22IR Flush Mount Rear View Camera with 0.5 Lux Night Vision,This is my second of these cameras purchased to install in a tailgate for use as a backup camera. The first one had it's lens trashed when the glass cracked and water got into it. I replaced it with a new one and the glass cracked on this one too. This is happening on normal use of driving over less than perfect roads. So now this camera lens will constantly fog up and impair the camera. The company needs to have replacement glass lenses for these cause they are too fragile for auto use.,2
PYLE PLCM22IR Flush Mount Rear View Camera with 0.5 Lux Night Vision,"Item arrived with all specified parts and in working order (including the drill bit) Installation is a little time consuming, so don't take this on if it's your first try at car audio / video. Unfortunately there were no instructions, and wires on the harness from the camera were unlabeled but luckily they were easy to figure out. The video out line is easy to spot as its the industry standard yellow RCA cable (17' extension included) The positive voltage that powers the camera is the wire that has the fuse in it (this line connects to the white back-up light in your tail lights and powers the camera) The remaining line is the ground and can be attached to almost any bare metal on vehicle, I usually choose a screw somewhere close. The cables included are long, but you may need to an extension for the power wire (to tell the receiver when to turn on the rear view monitor). I chose to extend the wire from the tail light so the video camera and the receiver got the same signal. The top of the camera is not noted, so you'll have to adjust it after installation. The camera automatically adjusts between regular and IR mode and the LED's around the lens will not light up. You'll know when it's in IR mode as the picture will change from color to B&W. The field of view is a little constricted compared to many cameras, but its enough for me (I can't see the corners of the vehicle, but can see behind me).",2
Q-See QS100B | UL Rated E475392 Video & Power Cable | Extend Your Original Camera Cable | Prevent Video Loss & Interference | 100 ft BNC Male Cable with 2 Female Connectors,"Of course this cable isn't the thicker Q-See QSVRG100 Shielded Video & Power 100 Feet. But this is what the average customer of a q-see package wants to know- just how thick IS the darn cable? The answer in simple terms is that it's thicker than the stock 60' cables, and thinner than the shielded cable. So it's in the middle of the two in terms of thickness. I was glad to see it be thicker than the stock 60' cable for sure, considering it's 100' run. This cable can also be used as a replacement cable, not just an extension to a 60' cable. Without any BNC or power adapters that come with the cable needed, you can run it right from the dvr to the camera. And if possible, that is the best way to go. Avoid any multiple extension cable runs if possible, which could degrade the picture quality. I just installed one run today- three more to go. As much as I tried to be delicate with the cable, I put it through what you'd expect- a little knotting to untangle, a little crimp under a floor board in the attic, and a little pulling stress to feed the cable around. Yes, I tried to be careful with it but I'd do the same for any cable. Part of the job is the cable gets a little stressed during installation. All I can report is that the cable held up to the install. The picture is in fact, fantastic. I did as much as I could by installing weather proof electrical seal tape at the camera terminals, and also in spots along the run that could be a rubbing problem over time. BTW- pick up the white color weather seal electrical tape for your install job- worth it. Also be certain you have the proper ends at each side, for the dvr and the camera. It matters. You'll need a seprate power supply for this or any run longer than the stock 60' cable. Visit q-see directly online to find out which one you'll need for your cameras. The cameras will NOT work any other way- it's a must do. My motto is usually- cheap is cheap, cheap is expensive. I admit it, with this one I rolled the dice and went for the less expensive option. I needed three of them, so shoot me- I cheaped out a bit. But I figure heck, if I get a year or two out of the cable I saved some bucks up front. Who knows, maybe the they'll last even longer. Cables are cables- if they're working they usually stay working for the long haul. I'm feeding CMOS 400 TVL cameras too- entry level cameras that I plan on upgrading over time. So I'll hope these cables last until I'm ready for better cameras, and then install good cables for them. In the mean time, I'm looking remotely right now at an excellent night picture from this 100' cable. No extra noise- great picture and the daytime picture is excellent and clear. So right now- two thumbs up! I'll update my review if that changes over time.",4
Q-See QS100B | UL Rated E475392 Video & Power Cable | Extend Your Original Camera Cable | Prevent Video Loss & Interference | 100 ft BNC Male Cable with 2 Female Connectors,"I have q-see 8 camera DVR and 1 of my camera's was too far for the 60 feet cable included. I ordered this from amazon even with the so so reviews. The cable came, I checked it with my easy to get camera. The BNC extension worked just fine, but the power did not work. Sent back to amazon that day (1 hour after receiving), amazon sent me a new one the next day. Tested it on the short camera everything worked just fine. Ran the 100ft extension + 60 ft of original camera. All worked fine during the day. Problem comes at night. The camera requires more power at night for night vision. Sure enough this camera does not work at night. All the other cameras work just fine at night. Too the A/C adapter and plugged directly in camera (everything in easy to get to attic) and works fine. Plugged power directly into the 100ft cable (minus the 60ft to the dvr) and it did not work. Even with the a/c adapter in my attic, just for this camera, the 100ft is too long and does not carry enough power for the cameras at night. The 60ft cables work just fine, but if you need to get power down this 100ft cable for night vision forget it. Night vision is not really that important since it is only good for a short distance and the cable works during the day so I am using it because other cables are more expensive and who knows if the A/C adapter with the q-see system will go 160ft??? For me I needed to buy another A/C adapter, just for this camera. Plug in with extension cord to the camera in the attic. Then all works fine since BNC cable runs to the DVR. So 1 worked barely, the other didn't at all and I tested right out of the box.",4

This cable worked perfectly and was exactly the length I needed. I like that it's white because it blends in with the roof's underside.

All four original 60' cables and the 100' extension have worked fine, weathered fine, and have not had any interference or power outages.

All of there items are high quality and this cable is no exception. I've handled a few different pre-made and they were pretty cheap and flimsy and the ends broke easily so you had to be super careful!BUT this cable is thick and sturdy and was a great replacement cable for the dvr system. A word of advise, do not unwrap this cable until you are ready to run it in the attic. It gets tangled up very easy and you do not want to be trying to untangle it in a hot attic.",4
Panasonic BL-C131A Network Camera Wireless 802.11,"Panasonic does zero improvements to their recording/viewing software and it's upsetting. Camera that costs around $300 should have adequate software support. Recording software can record only one camera, so if you have two, like me, you'll have to have two separate Windows machines and record each camera on a different machine. Browser viewer software works only in IE, so if you're on Linux, or for whatever reason unable to use IE, you won't be able to hear any sound, only images. Also these cameras die. My last camera I bought on Amazon for $200 used has died within 6 months. It also displayed extremely blurry images, if I didn't have same camera that worked well I'd assume that's the quality of the images this camera provides, Can't tell how frequent this problem occurs, possibly lens misalignment occurred during shipping, I should've returned the camera immediately, but I though it was manageable. Camera died anyway within 6 month as I said. So overall I'd look for a newer competing product and strongly advise against buying this camera.",4
Panasonic BL-C131A Network Camera Wireless 802.11,"The ""Panasonic BL-C131A Network Camera"" is a feature rich wireless network camera that was surprisingly easy to setup for both in home viewing and Internet access. I was slightly concerned after reading the detailed steps in K. Lam's excellent review (currently the top review for this product) but now think that it must be dated since the included software took care of all the steps, including setting up the Internet access and free viewnetcam account. The box includes the camera, power supply, various mounting hardware, a security cable, documentation and quick start guides, and installation CD. The initial configuration of the camera requires it to be connected to your router with an Ethernet cable (not included) so it can be discovered by the installation software. Setup is very easy once the camera is discovered, but you must know your wireless SSID and security settings if you are going to use this in the wireless mode (also remember to set the switch on the bottom when finished). Once the basic setup is complete, the setup for remote Internet viewing next. The scary part of K. Lam's walk-through was not needed as the camera software took care of the port forwarding by talking directly to the router and then connected me to the viewnetcam website for registration. Once that was complete, I had my own easy to remember URL for viewing and controlling my camera. Total setup time was about 30 minutes and no calls to the tech support line were required. You connect to the camera via your standard browser (IE 7, Safari, and Firefox worked fine) so no proprietary software is required. The interface allows you to Pan and Tilt the camera and change most of the options by selecting the tabs along the top. It is a fairly intuitive interface and is easy to navigate for even those who do not posses an IT degree. A quick tip, the display resolution defaults to 320x240, which shows a fairly small image in the browser window, this can be changed to 640x480 in the drop down window to show a much large image. Overall, I am very pleased the image quality, ease of setup, and ability to remote view and control the camera. Highly Recommended! CFH",4
Panasonic BL-C131A Network Camera Wireless 802.11,"Only 4 stars since it's reliance on Windows and Windows Explorer. (but updated to 5 stars now) It is wireless or wired, pans and tilts, has a microphone, it comes with its own DDNS account from Panasonic and includes a lot more features than most did when it came out. The only bad thing is that it requires a windows machine with windows Internet explorer to listen to sound and I'm a mac user. I haven't found anyway around it. You can use multiple different apps to view this camera and pan and tilt from your iPhone too-- no volume again though. If anyone's found a way to get volume on a mac or iPhone please comment.

VideoSecu 100ft HD Pre-made All-in-One Video Security Camera Cable Power Extension Wire Cord with BNC RCA Connectors for 720P 960P 960H CCTV Surveillance DVR System A1E,"I probably shouldn't have bought this but kind of rushed into my project. This is not your typical coax or power cable. The wire gauge for the video and power is a minuscule 28 gauge, and the outside diameter of the cable is about 1/8-inch, with both power and video in the same cable jacket. The conductors are like sewing tread. I don't recommend this product. Use RG59 or RG6 for the video and 18-gauge twisted pair or bell wire for power and you will be better off in the long run.",3

These cables are not as thick as the cables which came with the system and I'm looking for sub-connectors (barrel connectors) so that I can use them instead of these cheaper cables.

I can see this stretching or eventually failing when used in anything other than a simple interior run.

I should have learned the first time. I thought two of my cameras might have been messed up so I swapped them out. I still have the exact same problem. The picture is very very fuzzy especially at night. There are lines in the picture and if the wire isn't placed just right the whole picture goes out. I have to fiddle with the wire to have the picture come back. The wires for my other two cameras are the ones that came with the camera they are perfectly clear.

I don't see any signal degradation. However, the two RCA Adapters are worthless. They are incorrectly sized on the RCA end, and will not provide continuity when plugged in... I had to get the camera connected one night, so fortunately I had a hunk of coax with a BNC connector on it, and a hunk of coax with an RCA connector on it. I sacrificed both cables by cutting them a few inches from the connectors, and then spliced the two together, to make my own adapter. It works great, but not as elegant as the adapters... If you don't really need the adapters, or if you already have some, the cable is worth five stars. i.e., If graded separately, the cable would get five stars, and the adapters would get zero stars...",3

Maybe this is why the connectors are so sensitive. If I bump my dvr, I loose the picture. So I just wiggle them again to get picture back.

First Alert CO615 Dual-Power Carbon Monoxide Plug-In Alarm with Battery Backup and Digital Display,"I bought two of these after another cheaper carbon monoxide detector had alarmed in the middle of the night. I had read some reviews of the other carbon monoxide detector having false alarms and convinced myself it was probably a false alarm but I opened windows to air out the house. I got these two days ago and they alarmed the first night. I opened the windows and deduced that it was probably my tankless water heater which was recently installed and failed inspection. It is scheduled to be brought up to code this week. To prove my theory I made sure the central heat was off for a day and we hadn't used the clothes dryer for a few days and I put one of these detectors in the laundry room where the tankless water heater is installed. We have one of those large jacuzzi style baths in the master bathroom (hence the need to have the tankless) and we took a bath last night. When we were done the alarm was going off. I had done some minimal research before doing this test and knew that too high of a level (12,800 ppm) can kill you instantly after just 2 or 3 breaths. I had read that 400+ can be lethal. Wikipedia states 800 ppm will cause dizziness, nausea, and convulsions within 45 min and you will be insensible within 2 hours and 1600 ppm can kill you in 2 hours. So I went downstairs to see what the reading was. I held my breath and went in. 875ppm is what it read. I called 911 and the firemen came. My wife, 2 year old, and 2 month old were upstairs and in a room with the windows wide open. They came in and took their readings. They said they are not allowed to work in an environment where the levels are above 30 ppm without respirators. The windows had been open for 15 minutes and they were still getting readings over 70. Later, we compared what their professional monitor said to what the my 2nd First Alert Carbon monoxide detector was reading (remember I bought two of these). Their reading matched exactly what this unit displayed. So you can trust these devices. Please trust your device. Thats what you bought it for. Call 911. Open windows or get out of there. The long term affects of Carbon Monoxide exposure can cause heart problems, learning disabilities, and many other terrible things. I am now worried about what this has been doing to my family over the last 4 months since the water heater was installed. Like I said I have a 2 month old.... I have posted a picture of the unit reading the max value from last night.",4
First Alert CO615 Dual-Power Carbon Monoxide Plug-In Alarm with Battery Backup and Digital Display,"I purchased three of these First Alert carbon monoxide alarms here on Amazon.com (two in 2008 and one in 2010) for placement in different locations around my house. One of these CO alarms - most likely a 2008 purchase - has just recently given up the ghost and gone into permanent error mode on the display which means that it's time to purchase a new replacement unit since the alarm's rated useful service life of about 7 years has expired, apparently just a bit on the early side (by about 1 year). Well I just ordered a replacement alarm from Amazon, but it wasn't this identical First Alert model. Instead, I decided to purchase the comparable CO alarm by Kidde (Kidde 900-0234 Nighthawk Carbon Monoxide Alarm, Long Life AC Powered with Battery Backup and Digital Display - see my review) which I prefer for several reasons based upon my more than 6 years of experience with this particular First Alert CO alarm. 1) The aforementioned Kidde CO alarm is a truly dedicated plug-in unit with battery backup. The entire unit must be plugged directly into an AC outlet of your choosing where it can be rotated from the vertical to the horizontal (or anywhere in between) to provide a more convenient fit as needed. Since all of the AC outlets that I use for these devices are easily accessible, I have never had any use for the small, snap-on AC adapter with an extra length of cord that the First Alert model provides for easier access to inconveniently located power outlets while keeping the more bulky main alarm housing at a more distant and convenient location. This specific feature has been nothing short of a nuisance over time with the small, flimsy brackets that hold the AC adapter in place on the back of the unit eventually breaking off resulting in an alarm that no longer can be plugged flush into the wall outlet unless you resort to less-than-perfect repairs to reattach the AC adapter with tape, etc. Unless you definitely need and/or want to mount your CO alarms at a distance from the power outlet, the Kidde CO alarm is the clearly more durable, all-in-one, easy-as-pie solution that you should purchase. 2) Since the batteries usually need to be changed no more than once each year, backup battery accessibility (2 AAs) is ""too convenient"" on the First Alert CO alarm. The batteries are located behind a relatively flimsy hinged plastic door/latch directly beneath the main LCD display on the front of the unit. This door opens relatively easily, but closing it can frequently be a problem as one or the other of the hinges seems to catch on something and provide significant resistance when attempting to do so. I have on more than one occasion thought that the door might break, but it never did. The Kidde alarm provides battery backup via a 9V battery that is kept nicely out-of sight and out-of-mind in its battery compartment that can easily be accessed by removing a single screw with a Philips screwdriver. No worries about any potentially broken plastic doors, hinges or other parts here! 3) The display on the Kidde CO alarm is a very nice, bright, always easily legible (even at night and at a distance) red LED which in my opinion is far superior to the LCD display that First Alert uses on its model. Unless you activate the much needed back lighting by pressing the appropriate button, the LCD display is very difficult to read. 4) The error code malfunction on the display (and associated beeping/chirping) indicating the useful service life of the alarm has expired and it needs to be replaced is not set to occur until 10 years after first powering the unit on with the Kidde alarm. The First Alert alarm is set to do this after only 7 years have elapsed and in my case (see above) this apparently occurred after only 6 years. 5) The manufacturing date of the CO alarm can be easily and clearly read on a sticker located on the back of the Kidde unit while trying to find the specific manufacturing date of the First Alert alarm (I am referring to my units from 2008 and 2010.) is like playing a game of hide and seek. I still have not been able to determine the manufacturing dates of my First Alert alarms. Note that unless there are small children or other individuals at home who are likely to tamper with the CO alarm by unplugging it, etc. there is really no need to activate the optional anti-tampering functionality (alarm arrives with this feature turned off) on the Kidde CO alarm. Who needs or wants a loud warning alarm to go off every time that there is a power outage of any sort - definitely not me! Nevertheless, as far as the actual functioning of the CO alarm itself is concerned (accuracy and sensitivity, testing capability, last recorded peak CO value, etc.) both manufacturers do indeed provide the consumer with essentially comparable devices. From a purely technical perspective, you really can't make a wrong decision in choosing either one of these home carbon monoxide alarms.",4

2.4 Ghz Wireless Surveillance System,"PRODUCT DOES NOT WORK. Some of the more positive reviews are from 2010-ish. Well, I purchased this item in 2016. I figured the low price tag meant the quality wasn't going to be great, but I really didn't expect to receive a non-working item. First, just as most reviewers had stated, the instructions are less than minimal. Not that one needs a whole lot of guidance to plug in a couple a/v wires, but there was no troubleshooting information whatsoever. (I should have posted a picture of the instructions before packaging it for return.) Second, the parts included didn't match what was on the parts list (instructions). It claims that the package should have one 8v and one 12v adapter. I received two 12v adapters. There was no 8v which is what the camera uses. It also included a 9v battery attachment for the camera. I tried that and still, the camera did not work. If it did, then it was the receiver did not work. Either case, the product was useless. Additionally, the packaging was horrible. I really could care less about the packaging as long as I received a working item but the care in which it was packaged really say a lot about the quality of both product and manufacturer. The components came in a plastic INNER container but there was no outer box or bag or any other kind of exterior packaging. The parts were loose when I opened up the Amazon box that the order was in. And Amazon fulfilled this order! I recommend to stay away from this product. Don't be fooled by the ""helpful"" video. The video is too old to be relevant for the current stock being sold by JMC. Or it could just be a seller's spoof (fake videos/reviews posted to offset the truthful negative reviews.)",2
2.4 Ghz Wireless Surveillance System,"Comes with everything stated, but quality of manufacture is flimsy. I ordered two of these (under different product names, but same item) and wouldn't recommend them to anyone for any practical use. If you are looking for something to spy on someone in the same room as yourself and the camera, this is your solution. That is, assuming the camera powers on. One of my two did not even power on, which I guess is fine since they are set to channel 1 with no option to change that so operating two units in the same setup - best of luck to you. How come I cant award this product ZERO stars?",2
2.4 Ghz Wireless Surveillance System,"The system is limited for connecting to any monitor device. I have 4 TVs and several computers, The analog RCA (composite) connection would only work on 1 TV. The signal was lousy and Fine Tuning knob was iffy at best. If the connection was a cable outlet I could have connected it to my PC where I was hoping to record video. Not that it would be a good recording on any device. Its a cool camera even with the poorly designed stand that has limited adjustment and no way to detach it. There is also a 1"" antenna that they fail to show in the pictures. I know its a cheap price.. and that is what you get.. a cheap toy! I will be returning this and spend a couple bucks for a wifi camera.",2
2.4 Ghz Wireless Surveillance System,"This item works exactly as advertised and quite easily so as well. However, The advertised distance and reality are far apart.

2.4 Ghz Wireless Surveillance System,This is tiny and ridiculous. The image is as good as much bigger cameras and the little antenna and stand are not much bigger than the camera.
