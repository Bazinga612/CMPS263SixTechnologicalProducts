"Sony KW-34HD1 34"" Trinitron HDTV","Finnally Sony is trying to catch up to the competition. But with a huge price tag more then double their competitors of the same size hdtv set who are they kidding. And of course this model is not available anywhere. You can not even find it on sony's web site. So amazon knows about it but that just means they plan to sell it in the us. Who knows when, and at $...I don't see them selling to many. Don't get me wrong I love sony products everything I own is sony, if this product was priced comparably with it's competition I'd be at the store right now picking it up. Looks like the competition is still got the upper hand on HDTV. I hope sony corrects this soon as it's almost football season.",4
"Sony KW-34HD1 34"" Trinitron HDTV","We initially were purchasing a cheaper tv...Well that was until we were educated by tweeter. This Television is a beauty...make no mistake!! The picture is clear, crisp and concise. Set up was not as I read in previous reviews as being easy, it was anything but easy. But then we(my husband and I) are not techo buffs. My son has since played with it and is finally set up perfectly. we love it and that says alot because i am definately not a couch potatoe...but not I cant wait to get home to veg out on the couch with my remote in hand....Incidently we also purchased the sony 5 disc progressive scanner dvd/cd player and love it too",4
"Sony KW-34HD1 34"" Trinitron HDTV",This TV is excellent. I watch HDTV movie channels through Dish Network and the picture is incredible. Compared to the huge projection TV's this TV's picture is unbeatable. It compacts 1080 lines into a space of 34 inches as opposed to 64 or another big screen size. This tv makes going to the movies obsolete.,4
"Sony KW-34HD1 34"" Trinitron HDTV","This TV is amazing. Images are crisp, color is great, resolution is stunning, and the technology is impressive. You will not be disappointed with this HDTV! Setup was very easily and it is virtually self configuring.",4

"Sony KP-43T70 43""  Projection TV","This is a GREAT TV! The picture (depending on source) is phenomenal. The size (video picture and physical object) does not overwhelm you. The TV can be viewed comfortably without being on a TV stand. The design of the TV & remote is excellent. I had an opportunity to view this model in a store, and my eyes were drawn to its picture quality (and I had to remind myself of its physical size). This TV fits well in a room size 13x13. It can be viewed comfortably even sitting a couple of feet from it. There are five picture modes, 2 of which can be programmed to the viewer's preference. Because of its size, widescreen movies are enjoyable (before, when choosing a video as either VHS or DVD, I would pick VHS if the DVD was in widescreen format). There are 4 video displays, three of which can be programmed to accept 8 different components. Sony has included a lot of programming choices in this model. Connecting a receiver, VCR and DVD (and getting them to work) took about 4 hours. The TV needs to be off when connecting a component. Each component should be added one at a time, rather than plugging & connecting everything at once and then turning the TV on. Apparently the TV needs to 'read' each component before it's recognized. The manual was somewhat confusing (because there are usually 2 to 4 combinations to use), but after a component was added you just follow from the previous example for additional components. P.S.: the more components you add, the more every cable & power cord needs to be labeled. The remote is comfortable to handle. There are problem with it though: 1) in order to use a component, more than just one button needs to be pressed; 2) you still need to use the remote that came with the component. This can easily replace a 27-inch to 36-inch TV. It weights ~150 pounds and the footprint is small (20 D x 37 W x 42 H). As the source of the picture increases in quality, especially from the local TV stations, this model will be enjoyed more and more. Then a viewer will have a true movie experience at home. I chose this TV based on: 1) picture quality; 2) video size & physical size; 3) design; 4) price [remember what you paid for your current computer? It will outlast it! ] If you can find a vendor, buy it! Do not wait! It will be the best investment!",4
"Sony KP-43T70 43""  Projection TV","While shopping for a large screen television, I had considered the 32"" and 36"" Sony WEGAs. However, this 43"" Sony projection TV had key advantages over the CRT WEGAs. KP-43 Advantages: Thinner (shallower depth) than the 36"" WEGA; Lighter (about 100 lbs) than the 36"" WEGA; and Larger screen viewing area (43"" vs 36""). CRT Advantages: Wider viewing angle (both vertical and horizontal); and Shorter minimum viewing distance. Although the KP-43 projection TV has a larger screen, it is lighter and can be moved more easily. It also is a good choice for apartments or other smaller living spaces. If picture quality is critical to you, then you should be aware that you may lose detail in the shadows since the black levels do not seem to be reproduced as consistently or accurately as a professional monitors. To calibrate your TV for your viewing environment, I recommend renting the ""Video Essentials"" DVD. In general, you may need to decrease the PICTURE (contrast), BRIGHTNESS, and SHARPNESS settings to achieve the best picture quality. With the factory settings, you may notice blooming and additional noise. You may also notice all the noise from traditional cable and broadcast signals. Therefore, you may wish to subscribe to digital services. There is a single component video input on the TV, which may not be enough if you have digital cable and a DVD player. You may need a separate component video switcher to accommodate multiple component video sources, or you could sacrifice some picture quality and use S-Video connections instead.",4
"Sony KP-43T70 43""  Projection TV","I was recently in the market for a larger screen TV set. The 32 to 36 screen was going to be the perfect size given my family room deminsions. I was considering the Sony WEGA XBR, Toshiba, and Misubishi. Then one day as I walked through one of the retail stores in my area, I saw the Sony 43' Rear Projection Set. The compact size, the Larger Viewing Screen, Picture Quality, Enhance Digital Features and The Price, were very impressive. My search was over. It's been a week since the TV was delivered to my home and I can truly say that it has been a wonderful experience. There are a couple of things to be aware of: * Getting all the components connected can take a little time. * Limited space in the Stand for adding components. Overall I think Sony 43' is a great investment if your considering 32 to 36"" TV's. You'll get excellent picture quality at a better price point.",4
"Sony KP-43T70 43""  Projection TV","I just purchased my TV about a week ago. The picture quality is very good, most people think it is a direct TV not projection. The built in screen protector gives the picture more clarity. And the TV definently benefits from a digital source such as satellite tv. Hooking it up is somewhat confusing if you have a number of components. For the money I don't think you could find a TV of this size with better picture quality. My only complaint is not with the TV, but with the optional matching stand. The stand is pretty much useless if you have more than two components. You cannot put two components side by side because the stand is not wide enough. And even after removing the shelf, it is not tall enough to stack components on top of each other. The stand needs to be about 3"" taller and 4"" wider. Sony's designers obvivously did not put a lot of thought into the stand when it comes to function.",4
"Sony KP-43T70 43""  Projection TV",I just got this and it is incredibly clear! I thought myself that this was a direct view in the store until I really looked close. The picture is so sharp and detailed. The built in screen saver makes it look even more like a direct view. Channel labels and easy set up make everything go easy. The color tubes will even align themselves at the push of a button! Put in A Bug's Life on DVD on this TV and you'll think you are there. You can't go wrong with it.,4
Toshiba 50A61 50-Inch Projection TV,"Most clerks in the big box store will push you to buy hdtv wide screen. They are great but there is so little programming to see and the little there is requires a ""STB"" that cost 700 buck. Add in Dish or direct tv plus to access local hdtv station you must put a antenna on you roof. So i compared the major brand look at the non hdtv by sony, mit and panasonic. I felt the tosh is cheaper by hundreds of dollar. Also has the best picture to me but you really can't tell until you set it up in your home. Mine's look great even on cable.You can find this tv online or check at bb after a holiday maybe as low as 1100.",5
Toshiba 50A61 50-Inch Projection TV,"I was researching the current TV I have in my home and felt compelled to write a review. We bought this TV in November 1998. Yes, it is 16 years old and we have not one time ever had to repair it. There is no need to upgrade to anything since this works so well. Recommended.",5
Toshiba 50A61 50-Inch Projection TV,"I just purchased my first Big screen TV. I would like to say I did a lot of investigative work before i settled on the Toshiba 50A61. For the price ,quality looks workmanship I'm very happy about my purchse. I looked at HDTV,Wide Screen and all brands checked Best Buy, Sears, Wal-mart you name it ..But the picture is so clear and the features are some of the best for this price range.. I would suggest this television to anyone not looking to spend on the high end and still have a tv set that is top notch..you can't go wrong ...",5
Toshiba 50A61 50-Inch Projection TV,"Picture Quality is Superb,stero sound is good to very good.Remote control layout is also good to very good,but wish the bottom of remote was flat,so it would be less likely,to roll off the arms of furniture.The many hookups is a plus,with the convience of front audio and video hookups.Setup was fairly easy with the owners manual,with easy on screeen menu's which are selected with the remote control.Overall after reseaching and comparing features,with the other brands,Toshiba,was a standout value for the money.",5
Toshiba 50A61 50-Inch Projection TV,"Its great!!! No fantastic sitting and watching this set. We are the envy of many. I can't wait to watch world cup soccer on this. The new improved screen will prevent my kids fromscratching etc. Wow the 160 degree veiwing is unbelievable. I could not ask for anything better. The person in line wating to buy mine, can keep on waiting!!!! My next door neighbour wants to buy one too. I am happy I picked this. I will soon be looking to buy a surround system for it. Thanks for a good item. ...",5
Toshiba 50A61 50-Inch Projection TV,"I purchase this as my first big screen ,and after looking @ hdtv i notice the cost of this tv is by far the best in price and quality..Everytime i watch movies on this tv i'm more impressed with each viewing..to anyone thinking of buying a big screen; seriously consider this one @ the top of your list..******",5
Toshiba 50A61 50-Inch Projection TV,Until I move on to a HDTV this TV will suffice very well. The picture quality is excellent and watching my digital Direct TV system gives me a very nice picture. I have movie nights at my house with the suround sound setup and everyone is throughly impressed with the picture quality and size...,5
"Sony KV36XBR400 36"" Color TV","Wow, this Sony CRT blows away the LCD and Plasma's I've seen from today. If you can live with a 230lb behemoth this TV will not disappoint. The color and clarity with a good DVD player have left me unwilling to upgrade for many years. Computer gamers have known for years that CRT's provide a superior picture to LCD's and this still holds true for the most part. Another thing about this TV is the great sound quality. The benefit of the size of this television is it has REAL SPEAKERS that pump some serious sound. Once manufacturers went with flat televisions they started compromising on speaker quality to fit the small confines. This TV sounds amazing and has the best Base I've ever heard from a TV.",3
"Sony KV36XBR400 36"" Color TV",This television was purchased as a daily viewer and it has been great! All I added was a Sony Surround Sound System ($1200) and some digital cable and I was good to go! I recommend this television set if you don't want to spend the extra thousands to get a quality t.v.,3
"Sony KV36XBR400 36"" Color TV",ITS THE BEST T.V EVER IT HAS HDMI PORTS,3
"Sony KV36XBR400 36"" Color TV",LOL at this guy trying to sell this television..Im dying in laughter over here,3

"Loewe Planus PLA530 30"" Direct-View Screen TV","I purchased a Loewe Planus six years ago and it is still running strong today. The picture is clear and sharp with excellent colour, deep black levels and high contrast. Except for the VGA input, all video sources including the tuner are 480i but get digitized and displayed using a line doubler at 480p, producing a flicker-free picture. The built-in speakers provide amazing sound for a television, loud and clear with excellent bass though the ports in the back when the Planus is against a wall. The styling of the set is simple with the screen slightly forward of the side speakers, giving it a more artistic look than the shiny-plastic appearance most sets have today. Some things to consider: - Six years ago, this set was at the top of its class. It lacks in features compared to modern sets, however. - The set is a CRT and thus very heavy (~90 pounds). - The Loewe brand used to be distributed in the U.S. by Sensory Science, but is no longer. Expect parts/service to be hard to come by. - The set will only accept 480i through its component inputs; 480p sources (such as progressive-scan DVD players) will not display correctly. The only way to get true 480p is through the VGA input; there is no DVI or HDMI input. - There are five display options: - 16:9 = The video is stretched horizontally to fill the screen. Used to display 16:9 video squeezed into a 4:3 signal. All other display options are for regular 4:3 video. - 4:3 = The full video displays in the center of the screen unchanged at a 4:3 aspect radio. There are vertical black bars to the left and right of the image. - screen = The video is stretched uniformly to 110% its size. There are narrow vertical black bars at both sides of the screen. The very top and bottom of the image are cut off. Used to zoom in slightly on a 4:3 picture or to eliminate minor letterboxing. - cinema = The video is stretched uniformly to 120% its size and fills the screen with no black bars on the sides. The top and bottom are cut off. Used primarily to remove the top/bottom black bars from letterboxing. - zoom = The video is stretched uniformly to 130% its size and fills the screen. The top and bottom are cut off. The left and right edges are also cut off. - In the above display modes, closed captioning can only be displayed in 16:9 and 4:3 mode. Unless you are in 16:9 mode, turning closed captions on will reset you to 4:3 until you turn them off. This becomes noticeable when you set the closed-captions to ""Auto"" mode (captions are off normally, on when the audio is muted). - There is a feature to automatically detect letterboxing and adjust to the appropriate size. However, more and more television shows and commercials are in a widescreen format. Especially during commercial breaks the switching becomes noticeable depending on the content. - Picture-in-picture (PIP) location is adjustable. Input and channel settings for both inputs are remembered. - The on-screen menu system responds slowly but is laid out well. - The remote control is simple, well-organized, and well-constructed. My only complaint is that the volume up/down and channel up/down are controlled by pushing right/left or up/down on a solid plastic ring. If you do not push directly left or right sometimes it is easy to change the channel while intending only to change the volume. When you are on an external input source, this channel change will immediately switch you back to the tuner. - The onscreen connections menu lets you activate the various inputs and modes, but the only way to deactivate them is to reset all the connections. There are two antenna inputs, three video inputs (1 front, 2 rear), and one VGA input. The video inputs all support both s-video and composite. There is an additional component video input that shares its audio with VIDEO 1. The VGA input supports only 640x480 @ 60Hz resolution. - The power button on the front is a master power switch. Turning it off disables turning the TV on from the remote. Turning it on only puts the TV in standby mode. There is no way to power on the TV except from the remote. Despite its few disadvantages compared to modern displays, the Loewe Planus is a workhorse and stunning both visibly and audibly. Mine has given me no trouble in the six years that I have owned it, and I see no need to go HD just yet. I am rating it four out of five stars as it's a superb television for its age, but may not compare in features for its price against newer models.",4
"Sony KV-32XBR450 32"" XBR Wega Flat-Screen HDTV Monitor with PIP","... high-end 32"" & 36"" (4:3 conventional tube) TVs at national chain super store. The XBR series absolutely blew me away at 25 ft. The difference was even more astounding the closer I got. Nothing, not even the other Sony WEGA models compared to the XBR. I had to stick my face to within serval inches from the screen in order to notice the razor thin horizontal scan lines. I wasn't really planning on spending that much on a TV but I did not hesitate for a moment to reach for my check book for the XBR. With a little bargaining, I think I got mine for about... I've had it now for almost a year and I still marvel at quality of this unit. It has more AV I/Os than most users will ever need (component, s-video, and composite) 6 in all. I even replaced a fairly new DVD player for a model that had progressive scan so I could take advantage of the 480p feature of the XBR (""fabulous""). Also, my new XBOX (w/ the HD AV kit) really looks super on the XBR too. Go, shop, compare, see for yourself. I think only the LCD HDTVs have a better picture quality but they're still too expensive and have very little content to offer today and, I think It'll be a while before they do. So, 4:3 is still the way to go. Besides, the XBR is HDTV ready. I just wish that I could have bought the 36"" XBR but it wouldn't fit into my entertainment center.",4
"Sony KV-32XBR450 32"" XBR Wega Flat-Screen HDTV Monitor with PIP","I just got the 32XBR450 yesterday (2/9/02) and I absolutely love it. I wasn't intending on buying this TV when I went shopping but once I saw the picture and other features compared to the ""regular"" flat screen TV's I had to have it. The picture's incredible, the colors are perfect and the skin tones are right on the money. I havent hooked it up to a home theater system yet but the TV audio on its own is wonderful. I connected a DVD player that has the progressive scan feature (only works with HDTV TV's) and I used the component video cable connection. All I can say about the picture quality while watching a DVD is WOW!!!! It's crystal clear. It was just like being in a movie theater except that my recliner is much more comfortable and the picture was actually better. The picture-in-picture feature is better than any I've seen. It's called Twin-View and instead of a small box in the corner of the screen it comes up in a split screen so both channels take up half the screen. Then you can resize either one you want and as one gets bigger the other gets smaller. You can also use the picture-in-picture mode while viewing a DVD, VHS, video game system or any other input you have hooked up. There are also plenty of in-put jacks (6) so you can hook up just about anything you want. Overall it's just the best TV I've seen. The ONLY reason I didnt give it 5-stars is because of the price. I paid the same price thats advertised here but I got the stand included. Oh ya and it's HDTV (ready) so when all broadcasts go over to HDTV in a few years you'll be all set. If you can pay the price then go out and get this TV NOW!!!",4
"Sony KV-32XBR450 32"" XBR Wega Flat-Screen HDTV Monitor with PIP","This set is surprisingly good in the following ways: After owning this set for four months, I am astonished at how BAD other televisions look. When my friend bought a 32 inch WEGA (non XBR) and had us over to take a look, I was appalled by the overdriven picture, extensive red push and large gap between scan lines. It was like watching television through a set of venetian blinds. The same with another friend's Toshiba flat tube set. Further, if you're a gadget-type person. you'll appreciate the fantastically in-depth service menu. Every conceivable internal setting of the television can be accessed through the remote. We have dropped the red push altogether and the picture is considerably more pleasing than when the set was new. Finally, the resolution of the picture tube is so much better than standard televisions that flaws, edits, and manipulations in NTSC sources can easily be detected with the naked eye. This could be a turn-off for some casual owners; other television sets are too blurry and inaccurate to reveal the flaws in a broadcast. Not the XBR! With this set, the difference between high quality and inferior broadcasts is as plain as day. To sum up, this television is superior in every way. In fact, its superiority makes some common NTSC programming look pretty bad. Some owners won't like it, preferring to hide the flaws in the signal by watching through an inferior set.",4
"Sony KV-32XBR450 32"" XBR Wega Flat-Screen HDTV Monitor with PIP","We've had our 32"" XBR450 for about three months, and the whole family loves it. Coupled with a progressive scan DVD player (we have the Sony DVP-NS700P, also a great product), the picture is nothing short of amazing. Even VHS tapes look better with this TV, thanks to the line-doubling up-conversion process the signal goes through. The sound quality is also excellent--even has treble/bass adjustments--and has surprising bass output for a TV set. The picture-and-picture feature (scalable side-by-side twin views) is really cool; however, be aware that you won't be able to view two channels at once if you get satellite service. (You can still view different sources simultaneously, though.) The unit also has plenty of inputs, including two component video inputs (for high-definition sources) so you can hook up a DVD player as well as an HDTV receiver. While the price is high, for the quality, features and flexibility, you can't beat this Sony for 32"" models. I would recommend this TV to anyone who can afford it.",4
"Sharp Aquos LC-20B2UA 20-Inch Flat-Panel LCD TV , Silver","I bought this TV about five days ago. I was the highest cost unit in the store so I expected video quality at least as good as my old Sony TV. However the picture is fuzzy with high degrees of pixalization. For small graphics the pixalization causes actual ""sparkling"". After watching the history channel where they place small graphic on the lower right hand corner throughout the program I noticed that I was drawn to the graphic more than the actual show. I am going to get a 4:3 model or wait for the new generation of LCD with 3:2 drop-down and better conversion circuitry.",4
"Sharp Aquos LC-20B2UA 20-Inch Flat-Panel LCD TV , Silver","The compact size of this TV allows it to fit comfortably on the top shelf of a bookshelf. The picture is as clear as one can get without investing a whole lot more. When the Time-Warner CATV people have come to the premises, they have given it a ""WOW!"" rating.",4
"Sharp Aquos LC-20B2UA 20-Inch Flat-Panel LCD TV , Silver","some seans come out too blue but most of the time it is great. when I saw it in the stores it had animations on it not live action so it was harder to tell how good the pict realy was, but very nice pict great for the places you don't have room most tvs.the speaker space for the speakers on the sides is too wide. The speakers cabnets themselves could have been narrower, the cabnet the speakers are in are twice as wide as the actual speakers. I wish it was in black, since my purchase I have seen it refurbished in black,but no brand new in black. wish it didn,t cost more than a big screen.",4
"Philips 46PP9302 Epic 46"" Digital Widescreen HDTV-Ready TV","I researched RPTV's for over a year and my decision ended up coming down 2 RPTV's - the Philips 46PP9302 and the Hitachi 45F500, I looked at a number of manufacturers including Sony, JVC, RCA, Panasonic. My decision to go with the Philips was based on the extra video processing enhancments that come with this TV and the ""classy"" styling of this unit. As far as the picture quality goes both units provide excellent video but the Philips just seemed to provide a more stunning picture on HDTV and DVD progressive scan. The picture adjustments that can be made to tailor the picture to how ""you"" want it to look are seemingly endless - each input can be adjusted the way you want it. One other notable thing about the philips is the picture with satelitte - This is one of the few TV's with which the satelitte picture looks even good - and when it comes down to HDTV images it is downright amazing. One thing anyone should consider when buying a RPTV is the ability of the TV to provide some sort of screen protection from phosphor aging as I found out from my research there are some Tv's out there that have only lasted 3-4 years before the black bars wear into the screen. I have found that the 4.3 format is what I am using the most to view programming from satelitte so you get the black bars on either side of the screen so the black bar burn in could be a potential problem. The Philips auto format screen sizing is also one of the best available and not many of the RPTV's I looked at even had anything auto period! - you had to use the remote to fill the screen and the resulting picture was quite unporportional. Another deciding factor with purchasing this TV was the dealer I bought it from offerd me an additional 2 years parts and labor warranty as his comment was "" We have very few problems with any of the Philips TV's we sell and that's why we offer the extra 2 years"" . On the downside , (if any) this television as with most RPTVS is the viewing angle - it is very location sensitive - you need to view it sitting down and not to far off center - I have found that about 8-12 ft out and no more than 3-6 ft off center on either side is about maximum. A highly recommemded HDTV RPTV. Mw",4
"Philips 46PP9302 Epic 46"" Digital Widescreen HDTV-Ready TV",It is a great television. I have had it for 6 years never a days problem. But it doesnt do the true hd in 1080 like it should. A tech came out hooked it up to Satellite and said it is probably doing 720p at best. Also you cant use the pip if you are using hd. another drawback. Color isnt the greatest hard to fine tune tint and color . Woulddnt buy another Philips nor a projection. Save your money and get a LCD cant beat them better picture.,4
"Philips 46PP9302 Epic 46"" Digital Widescreen HDTV-Ready TV","I've had the tv for 2 weeks now and I love the picture quality especially w/HDTV signals. Even the look of the tv is great because it doesn't look like a big square against you wall. I only have two complaints. 1. When watching an hdtv signal you do not have the ability to adjust the screen size (i.e. 16:9). Some hdtv stations broadcast signals on their hdtv channel that are 4:3 ratio. 2. It needs to have at least 2 HD Component inputs instead of one component and one RGB input. It's difficult finding the RGB harness at an affordabe price. This only is a problem if you are planning to watch hdtv (with hdtv receiver) and a progressive scan dvd player. Other then these two issues, this is the best tv for the money. Highly recommend purchasing.",4
"Philips 46PP9302 Epic 46"" Digital Widescreen HDTV-Ready TV","After looking at multiple 40-51in. RPTV's, I purchased this Philips Model. The picture quality is outstanding, especially with Progressive DVD. The price was unbeatable for the high quality features and benefits this tv offers. The tv offers features not often found on more expensive models. I would suggest reading the entire manual and playing around with the remote to increase one's familiarity. Great picture, good looks, and a great buy for the buck!!",4
"Philips 46PP9302 Epic 46"" Digital Widescreen HDTV-Ready TV","I looked at a lot of different rear projection wide screen tv's and found this to be the best. I opened it up out of the box and it worked great. The horizontal viewing angles are good, however virticaly it is challenaged. The picture changes (dims) if you are standing up. Not bad for the money. It has awesome features and has one of the best picture qualities. I also like the sound. I give it an A+++++++++++++++++",4
"Philips 46PP9302 Epic 46"" Digital Widescreen HDTV-Ready TV","Spectacular picture, spectacular sound, at least when coupled with high-res DVDs (which is what I bought this for). EGL delivery service is well worth the extra charge too; in my case they got a little confused about which of their stations was closest to me, but I live in the boonies...and they were quick to correct the problem when I contacted them by phone.",4
"Philips 46PP9302 Epic 46"" Digital Widescreen HDTV-Ready TV","I haven't recvd my t.v. yet, but my Dad has this same t.v.. the picture is on of the clearest I have seen. When this hooked up with a surround system. Forget about going to the movies. The movies is at your home.",4

"JVC AV-48WP30 I'Art Pro 48-Inch Widescreen HDTV-Ready Rear-Projection TV , Silver","I just bought one of these used. It is my first HDTV (not counting watching HD TV through my computer.) As these reviews are almost all from when the TV was new, I figured I would write a review from the current perspective. First, the downsides: It only handles 1080i, not 1080p. Plenty for everything I've thrown at it; but those who have Blu-ray may want a 'real' 1080p TV. It has two 1080i-compatible component connections, and one DVI. No HDMI; although the DVI port works just fine connected to my HDMI-output HD DVD player via an HDMI to DVI cable. It has dual (now obsolete) NTSC tuners, but no digital ATSC tuner. Therefore, the tuner is essentially useless. The picture-in-picture can handle two HD inputs, but it can be a little flaky. It is a rear-projection TV, which means that it has a rather limited viewing angle. The picture looks great as long as your eyes are level with the top of the screen or lower, but playing Wii games that require standing up on it are difficult, because the picture dims very quickly when viewed from above. Likewise, the sideways viewing angle is about 90° to be at full brightness. It drops off quickly thereafter. Now, the upsides: Finding one used can be cheap. Potentially significantly cheaper than a new HDTV. The CRT-based projection system means that it doesn't have a high-power light bulb to burn out. The one I bought is now six years old; and the picture is very bright. (when viewed from proper angles.) In spite of the admonitions that the DVI port isn't computer-compatible, it works perfectly with my MacBook Pro. It supports 720p, or 1080i; with excellent picture reproduction. But, the DVI port does not have sound, so even through an HDMI adapter, you still have to use analog stereo audio (or use a receiver.) The picture looks wonderful, wether from an ATSC tuner (in a VCR/DVD Recorder, connected via component,) HD DVD, computer, or Wii. The sound, while only stereo with faked surround, is good. I have found no need to re-connect my receiver. Good volume, good tone, and enough bass.",4
"JVC AV-48WP30 I'Art Pro 48-Inch Widescreen HDTV-Ready Rear-Projection TV , Silver","Just got it on Saturday July 13, 2002. The picture is amazing. The only downfall is, to have that amazing picture, you have to watch DVD's. I have BEV as a satellite supplier. Most of the channels are clear, except for some, it seems the picture is too big for the channel. Now, I've upgrade from a 10 year old JVC 27"" (Best TV I've ever had). The picture just looks huge, I'm sitting approx. 11 feet away. The ideal viewing distance is suppose to be 9.5 feet.It's just so huge. Now, that may just be because I upgraded from a lot smaller to a lot bigger TV. I've watched approx. 10 movies on it, and WOW, I would never be able to watch them on anything else (unless it's bigger). Other little tidbits, is that when the movie is in letterbox (2.35:1), you still have the black lines on the top and the bottom. You can zoom in even more, but then you lose some of the picture. (my wife is very disapointed with this). To use the full screen when you are watching a 4:3 tv show or movie, the picture seems a little bit stretched, just takes a little of getting use too. If you are watching the TV from angles greater than 30 to 40 degrees, you really can't see very much. Besides what I've mentioned, it is a great TV for a great price, and a big plus, you can use the speakers for the Center channel of your receiver. I've also played my PS2 and XBox on it, it just blows your mind how detailed the games are now. I'm also having a technician coming in to make all the fine tuning on the TV (I don't want to lose the warranty, if I do it myself). So I will let you know if it makes it even better. I would give this TV a four and a half star, it lost its half a star because of the things I've mentioned above. And that is an assesment based on three days of having it. Give me a year, and I'll let you know if it has improved.",4
"JVC AV-48WP30 I'Art Pro 48-Inch Widescreen HDTV-Ready Rear-Projection TV , Silver","I've recently purchased this rear projection television and I'm very impressed to say the least. I've owned a Samsung 40 rear projection prior to this, which was also a very good TV, but nothing compared to this JVC bad boy. Some nice features include a DVI jack for future (some present) digital connections, a center channel input (although I've tried it and the sound is less than acceptable, perhaps its my receiver), numerous multiscreen displays including dual tuning for split screen, and most importantly exceptional picture quality. I believe it's the internal line doubler that creates such sharp pictures, or so they say. The clarity is really astounding for a projection TV, and what's more, the clarity is not limited to HDTV broadcasts, but the picture on regular cable is amazing as well. Let's face it, most of us do not spend most of our TV viewing time having access to HDTV broadcasts and receivers. Albeit a fortunate handful, but for the rest of us this television has excellent picture quality across the board. I highly suggest watching the Monsters Inc. dvd with a player using component connections. The clarity is breathtaking, many picutres truly appear to be 3 dimensional. But instead of relying solely on reviews, go out to your local electronics store, and take a look for yourself at this television against other manufacturers. And don't listen to large chain store electronics sales employees, they don't know what they're talking about. Happy shopping!",4
Zenith C34W23 34-Inch Widescreen Integrated HDTV,"I purchased this item in March 2003 and now in June it does'nt work! I turned it on one day the set stayed on approximatley 40 minutes and then the picture began to switch off and on off and on... I paid [a lot] for this item it should work great with no hassels! I'm writing this rewiew in an effort to warn other HDTV shoppers to be very wary of this product. The Manufacturers of these HDTVS need to understand the purchase of one of these sets is a major financial consideration for most people. I am now watching my old ...color JVC and you know what it looks better all the time! If you feel you must buy this model from Zenith see if the merchant will give you a couple of weeks to try the product. if not find another manufacturer.......I feel in order to be fair to Zenith I must follow up on my initial poor review with a progress report. After calling Zenith and venting my anger with them I contacted one of their service representatives A technician came to my house a couple of days later, he replaced the defective parts at no charge to me and now my TV works great and looks even better P.S. have it calibrated...",4

"Sony 36"" Flat-Screen TV With 2-Tuner PIP (KV-36FV300)","I shopped for a new 36 inch TV for 2 weeks. I went out to 4 different stores and looked at all the new models, from JVC, to Panasonic, to sony WEGA and XBR. I finally decided on THIS TV. The Model # is Fv300. This is the 2nd model down, (below HDTV) in the WEGA 36 inch line. The features such as infared headphones, picture in picture, ""WoW"" sony simulated surround sound, and a 3D DIGITAL COMB, as opposed to 3 line digital, which appears in almost all average price TV's. The 3D Digital does make a difference, and only beging in WEGA in the Fv300. There are two S video connectors (1 rear, 1 front), and plenty of A/V jacks in the rear (19 of them). Heres the catch, the stand. It cost me 219.00 bucks. Im not sure how much you can find it for, but that is the proper WEGA stand, custom made by SONY for this TV. Let me say...it is one SOLID stand and LOOKS like its worth over 200 dollars. It really does make the presentation. The cheapest quality stand you could find will still run between 99.99 and 169.99 anyway. So I suggest doing as I did, and just going for it. Another issue is the weight of this thing. It's easily 240lbs, some websites claim its more. If you plan on taking this home, your gonna need someone with an SUV or a truck, the box is enormous. I would suggest getting it delivered so you can have them put it right on the stand for you. Me and my brother are weightlifters, so we didnt have too much of a problem getting it in and on the stand , but I would suggest ATLEAST 3 strong people. All the weight is in the front, too. When your past all the setting up, your gonna be happy with your TV. The audio out connection is easy for a home theatre system. I connected a Sony system, and Im attempting to dual connect Klipsch 5.1's. So youve read about the TV, what are the differences in the different models of 36 inch WEGA? FS100- basic model, cheapest, no PIP, No 3d digital comb, No Tru surround sound...basically lacks important features. FS200- Adds PIP, and other basic features, but very similar to the FS100. FV300- This is the model I bought. PIP, 3D digital comb, free infared headphones (which allow you to listen to TV from a distance), etc etc etc...it's loaded. FV500- HDTV model, includes all features of the Fv300, but adds the somewhat ""gimmicky"" HDTV feature. It looks nice but you'll need an HDTV sattalite connection, or some other form to use it. ALso, not all stations broadcast HDTV. It is TV of the future, but its not here yet. Save the 500 bucks. Sony XBR- A step above WEGA, HDTV capable, and 40 inch. Runs double the price of the FV300. Ok, I just wanted to provide you with some insite after my purchase. I'm happy with the Fv300, and I know I made the right choice. Cant beat SONY, Trinitron, and WEGA all in one. I've got two trinitron computer monitors and I was SOLD on the TV just as quickly. They are the best.",4
"Sony 36"" Flat-Screen TV With 2-Tuner PIP (KV-36FV300)","We are extremely happy that we purchased this TV. I can't say enough good things about the KV-36FV300. The picture quality is outstanding. The filtering creates an image that will amaze you. Lines of resolution are almost unnoticeable and dot-crawl is minimal. We hooked up our digital cable with S-Video and the picture is excellent. I even saw a hint of pixelization during movement on one of the digital channels. This is of no concern because we don't have the HD converter box, but that shows how close this set comes to HDTV. Used the component hook-up for our DVD player. WOW!!! You can get buy with S-Video here but you'll not acheive what this TV can do for you. (Pay a little extra for the component cables!) Sony allows you to select either a 16x9 enhanced mode or Auto for widescreen dvd's and I've found the auto mode allows a bigger picture in widescreen with no sacrafice in picture quality. There are multiple sound and video modes fore each input to tailor each program, so you don't have to mess with settings constantly. Once you get the Clear Edge VM (velocity modulation) and the DynaBlack settings set the TV never stops blowing you away. The sound is impressive! It has a 15-watt subwoofer for deep bass when using just the tv speakers, but I prefer my Yamaha theatre system most of the time. The wireless headphones were a nice surprise! The quality is better than expected but the range is limited. These are great for watching those late night games when everyone's asleep. (sports fans, are you awake?) TV broadcasts through cable, particularly live sports, are simply outstanding. DVD signals are even better!!! And you can't find better sound from a TV anywhere else. Unless you want to struggle with an HDTV (at least until analog signals are outlawed), BUY THIS TV!!!!!!!!! (Advice: ...have it delivered, it's worth the money.) Cheers.",4
"Sony 36"" Flat-Screen TV With 2-Tuner PIP (KV-36FV300)","I waited 8 months for last year's $1699 Sony 36 inch TV to go on close out sale. It finally did, *but* then I saw the new model. Better picture - a truely amazing picture. And, imo, much better styling - not that clunky old dark grey box that most TVs have. Once my wife and I saw shows on the regular cable (non-digital) signal, we couldn't get over how sharp and clear and bright it is. Popped in a couple of old VCR tapes, and the difference between the new picture and that on our couple of years old Sony 27 inch, in terms of clarity and brightness, was amazing. Couldn't be happier!",4
"Sony 36"" Flat-Screen TV With 2-Tuner PIP (KV-36FV300)","This TV is rich in color and amazing in sound. The volume alone can go up and be as good as any sound system. We play Rock Band II at concert level on this TV and it handles it quite smoothly. I purchased this wonderful Picture-in-Picture TV in 2005. With HiDef taking over, it is a very bitter sweet purchase for me. Oh well...it is the best of a dying breed. 4 stars because although it is a great TV it weighs over 200lbs and is not HiDef.",4
Panasonic TC-22LT1 22-Inch LCD Flat-Panel TV,"I am a reviewer that is normally in the 2,000-2,500 range of Amazon reviewers. This review is anonymous purely from the privacy point of view. What I like about this TV is it seems to work. The large number of inputs is extremely useful, two S-video and two component video, I think there is the traditional 75 ohm cable connection as well. Switching the input also switches the audio output. So if you are like me and run the sound system using a separate amplifier and speakers this simplifies life enormously for wiring, the number of inputs required on the amplifier and for choosing the sound source on the amplifier. Picture quality is reasonable. I used to use a Sony 20 inch Wega which has the best picture quality I could find. The LCD picture quality is comparable and certainly watchable. For two people watching it had some very interesting side effects. Because it was so slim we were able to throw out the old TV table. Move the TV back closer to the wall. Move the sofa a bit closer and reclaim enough room behind to put in another book case. It doesn't seem to dominate the room as the old television did. The 16:9 aspect ratio is very nice when you have 16:9 material available. DVDs seem to come in native 16:9 and wide screen stripe across the middle to show on a normal TV. This TV set allows you to resize the picture within some limitations. There are more options for resizing on the s-video connection. Although this machine supports 480p subjectively the picture was not much different from a DVD source. Wish list, at this price and with this much flexibility it would be nice to play my Zone 2 PAL DVDs back in PAL. Note that LCD screens are not as delicate as the Plasma displays and are considerably cheaper. This one is one of the largest LCD screens available.",5
Hitachi 65SWX20B 65-Inch 16:9 Projection HDTV-Ready TV,We bought ours 5 years ago. If you are into sports and nature TV you can't beat this. You are right on the field or rink with the players or the wildlife. The one thing I would caution about is that your TV viewing will increase. High Definition makes everything you watch an experience and the size definitely only enhances it. You do need to have 12 to 15 feet minimum of room between your seating and the set to really enjoy this. A room 18 to 20 feet in depth is ideal. A good surround system also makes a world of difference as most high def is also broadcast in 5.1 surround. You can pack a lot of people around this TV and with the Olympics coming up we expect to be sharing our house a lot. In 5 years we have not ever thought of replacing this set as the quality has not diminished.,5

Hitachi 65SWX20B 65-Inch 16:9 Projection HDTV-Ready TV,"I bought my Hitachi 65SWX20B in the fall of 2002, and over 10 years later it works just like new. It has never had a service problem. It is my primary television and gets lots of use (5-8 hours daily). It has 1080I capability so the HD picture is very clear. I actually prefer the picture over some of the newer flat screens. The one drawback is the size of the cabinet, but mine has been built into a wall since first installed, so all I see is the 65-inch screen. Whatever Hatachi did in designing and manufacturing this television, they sure did it right !!",5

RCA F36450 36-Inch Diagonal Television,"Ok folks, this thing is pure junk. I bought this thing in September of 2002 for over $700. It was manufactured in July of 2002. In September 2004, it went dead, and started hissing whenever it was plugged in. An authorized RCA technician came to our house and looked it over. He determined that the flyback transformer was bad, and it had shorted out a transistor as well. The estimate to replace the flyback and the transister came to $300, and the technician couldn't guarantee that something else wasn't damaged--only that those two components definitely _were_ damaged. Of course, RCA only provides a 1 year warranty, so it's not covered, and here I am, 23 months from the date of purchase, and I have to go buy a new TV. The technician said that RCA seems to be having troubles with flyback transformers right now as well, so it's not like I was an isolated example. Stay away from this loser.",2

"ViewSonic VPW425 42"" Plasma Flat-Panel HD-Ready TV","O.K.----I think our man Steve from CA. might have been better served if he had read the owner's manual first, and then had professional installation. THIS IS NOT A HDTV! It will take the signal, but will have to ""dumb it down"" to display. But that display is absolutely gorgeous: sharp colors, wide viewing angle and NO artifacts. As for using the display as a computer monitor, I would be hard pressed to recommend it any higher. As with all viewsonic monitors I have owned in the past, apps from word processing to the newest games are just perfect. I connected my cable to a media center computer I built, and now use a nifty program called Snapstream that puts the old TIVO to shame! Now my wife can tape her soaps, easily burn her favorites to DVD, check her E-Mail, surf the web, video chat with her mom, play Tetris (O.K.---she's a little behind the times in her gaming!), find that song she has been looking for, etc----all from the comfort of our bed. She's now happy as a clam, which any guy will tell you pays the ol' hubby dividends far greater than the sub 3K cost of the unit. And I must admit, I can't wait for Halflife II on a big monitor with the display settings jacked to the max! Two caveats: Again, no HDTV. Perhaps more importantly, if you are going to set this unit up yourself, you ought be an enthusiast. Trying the many input choices enabled me to decide on the best option for myself, which proved to be the DVI for the computer, and the S-Video for all TV functionality except for DVD playback, which benefits with progressive scan connections (you know, that red blue yellow thingy). If you rely on the manual alone, you are apt to be left confused, as it is far too brief and poorly written. If you feel, as I do, that the PC is the future engine to drive home entertainment, this unit is an excellent partner!",3
"ViewSonic VPW425 42"" Plasma Flat-Panel HD-Ready TV","Even at the low price, this TV managed to disappoint in all categories. The remote is a giant brick with all the important buttons hidden under a slider. The image quality was fuzzy and poor. The screen would glitch every once in a while for no apparent reason. Any white or bright area on the TV (even with the brightness turned down low) would cause a terrible BUZZING sound from inside the unit. Weighing in at 90 pounds, it was difficult to even rotate it a little by yourself. Let me put it this way -- I had the TV for about 2 months before someone broke into my office and stole it. I was actually happy to see it go.",3

"ViewSonic VPW425 42"" Plasma Flat-Panel HD-Ready TV","This viewsonic T.V. is great as long as you know how to hook it up. Unlike regular T.V.'s if you hook up to this T.V. using the Coax Cable the picture will be awful. Now if you hook up using the S-Video, Componet, or Composite Video the picture will be perfect. That's why Plasma's are considered monitors instead of T.V.'s What the cable and satilite companies don't tell you is that you 50% of signal strength when you use the coax cable hook-up, or what others call the RF adapter. Regular T.V.'s can make up for this signal loss plasma's can't. So for all you out there do some research before you buy a Plasma.",3

Out of the box the default colors/settings need calibration, but once this was done the picture jumped off the screen. The images now look very accurate and life-like. There are ample inputs in the back of the unit to hook up just about any kind of home theater equipment. The only complaint I have would be with the slight buzzing noise the unit makes after warming up. It isn't very loud and from what I hear this is pretty much standard on most plasma's out there. All in all another great product from Viewsonic.",3

This TV is only capable of displaying 480p max, and can receive HDTV signals that are passed through an external decoder (the decoder is not built in). However those 780p/1080i HDTV signals are downconverted to 480p. Same with Progressive-scan DVDs. I wish I would have known this before ordering.

Tatung V17AFTW 17-Inch LCD Flat-Panel TV,"There would be no sound when ever there was a quiet scene in anything i was watching. Response: Why would a 'quiet' scene need sound? Isn't great that 'no sound for a quiet scene'? And customer service was the worst I have ever experience. A friend of mine had the same problem with his tv. So please stay away from this TV. Really? Ans: Tatung is very famous for its good customer service, not only in the US, but also in Taiwan and Europe. Are you kind of salesman from another competitor? Because I don't think you really own this TV, and possibly you know nothing about it. Now turn to the review: The TV itself is very good in color reproduction, and the response time is short (which means very good for game playing). Moreover, the overall appearance is also very nice. Well made LCD TV! I strongly recommend it to every one.",3
Tatung V17AFTW 17-Inch LCD Flat-Panel TV,"We purchased this TV last year. The quality is great, it has a sleek look and has a great remote. We had some problems though. After the TV was on for a while, we experienced a loud crackling in the sound, then the sound went off and the TV went to a blue screen. I contacted customer service in CA. They were GREAT. They were very responsive and they shipped me out a new TV under the warranty. I would highly recommend this TV. It has good resolution, a great picture, sleek design and a good price. Their customer service was top notch and very responsive. This is a high-end LCD TV.",3
Tatung V17AFTW 17-Inch LCD Flat-Panel TV,"Note: I would rate this product and company with zero stars if given the option! Do not buy this TV. I owned another Tatung television and tried to have it repaired under warranty. The TV, however, must be shipped to the company for repair - at the customer's expense. So their warranty requires $200+ right off the bat. So after my first disappointing experience with their customer service, the set quit altogether. Of course, the warranty period had expired now, but we still had only owned the TV for 2 years. I contacted customer service again and was told I could have it repaired by shipping it to them and paying a mere $700. So instead of wasting my money repairing this lemon, I plan to take my money and purchase a TV from a reputable company like LG. Congratulations to those of you who enjoy and appreciate the products and service of the Tatung corporation. The rest of us suckers now realize we should not waste money on their rubbish.",3
Tatung V17AFTW 17-Inch LCD Flat-Panel TV,"I have had better quality TV's from the Goodwill store. I bought my Tatung TV about a year and a half ago. Mine was actually a bigger one than this one but same brand. Right from the begining it had problems with the screen going out whenever it had an all white background on whatever show or commercial we were watching. I called customer service and they told me to do a reset and that it was probably my cables. I got tired of calling them and them not helping me so I just lived with the problem. Now, just a little over a year of having the TV, it just won't even turn on anymore. I paid 798.00 for this piece of crap and they won't honor their product. I guess its ok for a 798.00 TV to just stop working as long as its been over the one year warranty mark. This company should have stuck to making microwaves. I would NOT buy anything from this brand ever again. Try Goodwill, you will probably get more for your money.",3

I kept wanting to get another TV but as long as this one worked I avoided MOVING it. This thing weighs 325 Lbs, but has a brilliant screen. Finally it met it's demise and I have to say I'm sorry that it had to go but it is time for us to move on. My new replacement weighs in at 31 lbs and as you get older not only bigger is better but also lighter is better.

It's HD ready and the color/picture quality is unmatched by other tubes. You will even be hard pressed to find a LCD/Plasma in this size to compare w/ the quality.

The picture has so much color and detail it is like night and day. Like putting black and white up against color and this TV is a great product to showcase that. Only knock on it is it ways 300 lbs so the stand (which has bevel edges) is recommended on carpet. With the stand anyone could move it anyplace in the room with ease. Great Buy!",3
SONY KV-40XBR800 FD Trinitron(R) XBR(R) Wega(TM) Color TV,"i bought this tv as my first dip into the HD TV world, and i am shockingly impressed. the sound is amazing, the picture is flawless and the fact that it does NOT have a $300 bulb that needs to be replaced every few years makes it even better. yes, this TV is a monster, it is big and heavy but once you get it where you want it, it is 100% worth it. the features on the TV are great, and the fact that it has 7 inputs (3 of which are HD) means that i can plug in everything without having to worry about switching cables when it comes time to play a game or watch a DVD. Overall this tv gets a 9/10. it would be a 10 if it were not so heavy, that is the ONLY downside.",3
SONY KV-40XBR800 FD Trinitron(R) XBR(R) Wega(TM) Color TV,Great picture and color I have had this TV over 6 years and never had any problems with it at all. Has a much better picture in a 4:3: format as well as brightness and contrast control than the Panasonic VIERA TC-P50GT25 50-inch 3D Plasma I just bought. The Pani has a much darker picture so faces in night scene's are much harder to see than my Sony XBR. The only down side is that it was $3000 new and is 300 Lbs heavy.,3
SONY KV-40XBR800 FD Trinitron(R) XBR(R) Wega(TM) Color TV,"I purchased my unit (KV-40XBR800) Sony Trinitron XBR 40"" new in 2003. Within a year it failed to turn on (makes clicks, flashes the standby light, but does not turn on). Being under warranty, Sony sent a team of guys (yes, it's that heavy) to load it onto the repair truck. The unit was repaired, but failed again (this time the warranty was expired) with the same symptoms. Turns out the reps replaced the defective components with new components, which are plagued with this problem. A quick search on any major search engine for ""Sony Trinitron Flash Error Codes"" will reveal a vast consumer base plagued with this problem. There is no permanent fix as the parts needed to fix it are themselves the problem; any parts replaced will eventually result in the same failures due to the problem being in the defective part design and/or manufacturing process. Sony is aware of this, and is probably thankful the warranties on these units has run out. Do not buy this unless you have a team of guys to move it to a place where you intend to throw it away after it fails. Definitely fails the longevity aspect of TV ownership.",3
SONY KV-40XBR800 FD Trinitron(R) XBR(R) Wega(TM) Color TV,"FYI... Have had this monster-heavy TV for 10+ years, and it has operated flawlessly with incredible color and clarity production. Todays plasma/LED 'smart' units certainly are a world apart from this 'relic,' and I have some of these newer units in house, but this is still one of my faves to watch, whether tv broadcast or DVD.",3
SONY KV-40XBR800 FD Trinitron(R) XBR(R) Wega(TM) Color TV,"I bought this TV back in 2003. Just yesterday I got rid of it. Had a descent picture and was one of the best pictures out there in it's time. The 4:3 mode looked best. 16:9 was too small and the border lines were distracting. Hooking up a game console showed it's limitations as scan lines and other anomalies were always present. About a year ago I started having intermittent problems turning the set on.. No picture just a pop.. but sometimes it would work fine. It got to the point recently where it wouldn't turn on at all.. Found out that sony had a problem with 2 chip sets on the main power board. A common problem. I was deciding whether to fix it or now.. After shopping around.. I purchased an LG LCD 46"" TV which BLOWS away the sony in every aspect.. It was 1/4 the price and 1/10 the weight. Tube technology is history.. thank goodness. The weight of this TV is ridiculous. In retrospect.. I would not have bought this TV.",3
Sony KP-46WT500 46'' Widescreen HDTV TV,I bought this rear projection t.v. when it first came out in 2003 and I quickly fell in love with it! The picture and sound was impressive. Moving it around was easy as it is not as heavy as it looks. The manual was easy to read and connecting everything I had on it was simple. As the years went by I began to notice that the left and right side stayed brighter than the center of the screen giving it the appearance of a layer of film over the screen which was not pleasant to the eyes. I opened it which I do not recommend you do but I am electronically trained and the parts are very sensitive and can be dangerous to tamper with without little knowledge in electronics. I dusted of the mirror and screen and gently wiped the 3 lens inside with a professional cleaning agent and the t.v. was back at it's original performance that I was able to enjoy for 8 yrs now until the convergence chips went out on it just yesterday :( I love the t.v. so much and it has been with me for so long that I ordered the parts to repair it myself and hope to keep it another few years before I am able to save up enough money for a larger better t.v. in the future. I will update on the outcome of the repair as soon as I get the parts. Stay tuned!,4
Sony KP-46WT500 46'' Widescreen HDTV TV,"Pros: Solid video processing with CineMotion 3:2 pull-down; 46-inch, 16:9, HDTV-capable rear-projector; 480p and 1080i display capability; 3D-YC comb filter; two-tuner picture-in-picture mode; relatively inexpensive. Cons: No independent input memory; tabletop design is an awkward, in-between height; nonremovable protective screen. Summary: I have had this tv for almost 6 weeks and so far, I have never regretted buying it! The only regret is not buying it sooner! In fact, so impressed am I with the picture and the sound that I have already recommended it to a friend who is in the mkt for a new tv. After some research of his own and his own personally conducted ""eye-ball"" test, he came the same conclusion and purchased the set 1 wk after my recommendation. I believe the HD microfocus lens and picture tubes really work to produce a superb picture -- such that it's hard to believe that it's rear-projection and not the standart CRT which are purported to be clearer, but that in this case it's not! Also, the $3000CAD that we paid included the tv stand which makes it a great value when compared to other rptvs of this size. I watch only cable tv on this set and I am still amazed at the picture. I also watch DVDs on progressive scan and am very happy with the PERFECT picture -- which goes to show what it's capable of, given a superior signal. Overall, this a great widescreen TV.",4
Sony KP-46WT500 46'' Widescreen HDTV TV,"We've had this TV for a few months now, and the picture still blows us away. There are only a handfull of High Definition channels right now, but watching an HDTV broadcast, makes this set worth every penny. Watching sporting events in HD is like having a seat inside the stadium / arena(This set is a football lover's dream. ESPN HD is the coolest!). We looked at a bunch of different models, including some of the bigger screens, but this one is just the perfect size for us, and the Sony was the most highly recommended by salespeople(they always noted how busy repair guys were with some of the other models). A good store will have HD pumped in on all their TVs to help with deciding which unit has the best picture. The Sony was sharp, the sound was good, and the remote was easy to learn. Also, watching DVDs with the progressive scan is like going to the movies. With the different audio and video setups, multiple inputs(including a convenient front input), and universal remote(included), you'll be very pleased with this set, whether you're watching the latest movie on DVD, catching the playoffs, or watching your favorite show in HD. This one is a good choice.",4

Sony KP-46WT500 46'' Widescreen HDTV TV,"The Sony company should win an award for this HDTV it s the best picture I have ever seen. DVD's are super and HDTV for sports and PBS is fanstatic. BUY IT !! The only downside was the wait for the stand, and the lack of space for components below.",4

Samsung SPN4235 42-Inch Widescreen Plasma Flat-Panel HD-Ready TV,"We bought this TV via Amazon in 2004 and have been very pleased overall. At the time it was one of the cheapest 42"" plasmas available at around $2800, and now it can be had new for closer to $1500 thanks to the rapid developments in plasmas. If, like us, you don't have HDTV service or immediate plans to upgrade, it's a good choice. DVDs look excellent and standard channels (we use DirecTV and Tivo) look as good as they possibly could. Keep in mind, though, that this isn't a top of the line and will have some trade-offs. Most notably, the resolution is not true HD even though the TV can accept all HDTV formats and will display them at its own maximum resolution. Also, there are no built in speakers or HDTV tuner, but this isn't an issue when most people will use the unit with a surround system and cable box/satellite receiver. We route all our video sources (DirecTV, DVD, VCR, video game) through a $300 Sony surround system that routes the video into a single cable to the TV and the audio to 6 satellite speakers. If you have HDTV service the set does support the DVI connector but not HDMI, so you may need an adapter. She set emits an audible buzz that's loudest when the unit first turns on, but never goes away fully. It does not have a noisy internal cooling fan, though, as some early plasmas did. The set also radiates a lot of heat and draws a large amount of power -- more than 350 watts according to the specifications. Many people mistakenly fault plasmas like this one for premature burn-in when what they're noticing is only temporary. If you see the shadow of a previous image on the TV you need only watch something else for a few minutes and it's gone. Picture quality will be astounding for those upgrading from a standard CRT TV like us, but it's not perfect. Darks lack clarity and night scenes are often hard to make out. Bright scenes look excellent. We watch standard TV in the ""Panorama"" mode, which gradually stretches the square image to fit the rectangular screen. We prefer this to watching with gray (not black) bars on the sides of the image, but that mode is available too. DVDs will display in full 16x9 widescreen mode and look beautiful.",4
Samsung SPN4235 42-Inch Widescreen Plasma Flat-Panel HD-Ready TV,"I can't complain about this set at all. I originally had a used Daewoo plasma from sams club and it sucked big time, heated up the room like crazy, and constantly had ghosting. I returned it at sams club and bought a samsung spn4235 at circuit city because they had a promotion (2,700 dollars) plus a 300 dollar gift certificate. They were getting rid of the model to get in new ones. The only thing I was let down about was it was EDTV but I found out HDTV models were a heck of a lot more expensive. When I first got the model it had this weird clayface effect and the picture wasn't what I expected however I adjusted the settings with Avia home theatre setup and I was very impressed with dvd picture. I thought this was as good as it was going to get but recently I ordered HDTV through dish network. I thought the standard channels looked like crap but I was able to set my settings at 1080i and 16:9 and hdtv channels were amazing. The picture was very lifelike and colorful and it fit my whole screen without stretching. I watched the discovery channel and the DNIE option is great for hdtv viewing. The unit does decent with blacks but not the best. The set definitely can provide a great picture but every tv can only provide as good a picture as the source it gets from. My suggestion is if you go hdtv use either component or dvi and avoid svideo and rca cables. The price is great and if your looking to save money and have a good picture I recommend the unit. There is a slight buzzing noise but I haven't noticed it. Don't bother with the side speakers go with surround sound it will enhance your experience much more. Overall a very good unit and I am definitely not disapointed.",4
Samsung SPN4235 42-Inch Widescreen Plasma Flat-Panel HD-Ready TV,"I purchased this Plasma for a friend and have had it in my home for 2 weeks. I too have looked at many plasmas in the stores and compared. I have to say this one has a beautiful picture. Compared to true HDTV plasmas in the store, this EDTV has a great picture. It is hard to spend the extra money for subtle differences that are hard to see even side-by-side. Most of our viewing is cable or DVD movies so I can't rationalize the extra money. Even with a cable input, the picture is great. It is clear and has little ""noise"" or ""graininess"" considering it is a cable signal. Friends come over and remark what a great picture. Internal amp for speakers is fine. The Virtual Dolby does give good impact to the 2 speaker sound. For DVD's I use my separate surround sound system. One thing Samsung forgot on this model are audio output jacks to connect internal tuner sound to your surround sound system. So many other inputs, I don't know why they forgot those outputs. This is one of the few Plasmas that comes with a 2 year warrenty in home! The appearance of the TV is perfect in our home and looks great on or off. We are likeing it soo much, I will probably buy one for myself now that I have seen and used it my home.",4

Sony 53'' HDTV Monitor with Digital Reality Creation(TM) (kp-53hs30),"I've owned mine for over 2 years and have never experienced any problems. The resolution is FAR superior to any other 4:3 NSTC bigscreen on the market - no jitter, no blurry horizontal lines forming the picture (even up close), super-sharp colors and no ghosts. I play Blu-rays through an S-Video input and DVD's through my XBOX360 S-Video input and the clarity and color is absolutely superb - about as near as HDTV as you can get without paying for it. I currently watch HD TV with the included up-convert box from my cable provider and it looks amazing!! All PIP functions are great too - especially the split screen that allows you to watch two things at once with no distortion - this works extremely well if you have a WebTV, video game or computer hooked up to one of the four inputs so you can surf or work on your computer or play video games and watch TV at the same time! If you don't want to invest $5000 on HDTV, but still want the best picture money can buy - buy this TV! I HIGHLY recommend it!!!",3

"Sony KP-43HT20 43"" Rear Projection HDTV Monitor","I bought this tv a few months ago after a lot of debate. Sony always seemed to be the more expensive product, then it went on sale. 13,999 was the sale. after having to buy the necessary stand for 200, the sale price kind of vanished. Keep in mind that you will need some sort of stand for this unit as it sits too low for good viewing angle without it. The picture is great. As most people say, unless you have a good cable signal, the flaws will be very evident. But I bought this for movies. DVD's look awesome!! I only wish it was widescreen as most all dvd's come in 16:9 format. I know, why did I buy a 4:6 aspect then? Well, I don't like how if you are watching normal tv and the picture is cut down. I would definitely recommend this tv to others, but I would warn people to weigh their priorities.",4

Sony 50'' XBR Grand Wega Widescreen Rear Projection LCD HDTV Monitor (kf-50xbr800),"As mentioned in another review, the lamp has a limited life, I got more than the other reviewer, 5yr, but its still $200 and some inconvienence to replace, not the replacment itself but getting the part to the TV. Another problem I've noticed is that the audio quality is very poor. Either too muffled or female news comentator voices too tinny. I always though Sony audio would be outstanding but this is not. I have to run the audio through the stereo to get acceptable sound. It's very unlikely that this TV is available anymore as Sony dropped it ASAP.",2
Sony 50'' XBR Grand Wega Widescreen Rear Projection LCD HDTV Monitor (kf-50xbr800),The TV is great great picture quality and great features. It's everything you want plus more. There is one catch through which is that because this is a LCD tv the lamp burns out and you must replace it every year which i have to do. The lamp costs 200$ which is alot of money so unless you dont want to pay that and go through the trouble of buying a lamp buy another tv,2

Toshiba 51H83 51-Inch HDTV-Ready TheaterWide Projection TV,"WARNING! I've had this set for 2 years and have come to learn is does have problem. When you adjust the volume, an image of a volume bar appears on the screen. Over time, this image will burn itself on the screen. Make sure and select a set that lets you turn off the volume control image or moves it around on the screen to avoid screen burn-in. After weeks of reading about HDTV I came to the conclusion that eventually, you simply must make a choice and go with it. I feel like a made the right choice with this set. Viewing DVDs, the image quality looks every bit as good as I remember seeing it in a theater on the big screen. Older movies don't look quite as good but then again, they don't look bad either. For example, a new movie like X-men 2 is stunning while an older movie like Silverado is not quite as crystal clear. One nice surprise, regular cable TV looks very nice and the settings on the set allow you to display ""normal"" 4:3 format in the wide-screen mode with little notice of distortion. The back of the set offers many connection options. While the set is heavy, it comes with hidden casters that make it easy to move. I was somewhat concerned about the condition of the set on the day it was delivered as it was freezing cold and I worried that might harm the set. I let it adjust to room temp before I powered it up but the convergence was fine. Right out of the box I was totally pleased with the picture quality. I want to add that my set came fully assembled. I've been using it for about a month and I'm completely happy with it.",4
Toshiba 51H83 51-Inch HDTV-Ready TheaterWide Projection TV,"It's an okay TV set, as projection TVs go. Although it theoretically handles 1080i, it's too fuzzy to usefully perceive much more than 720p in practice. The biggest problem I have with this TV is actually a significant design flaw. Apparently, Toshiba thought they would be cute and put the remote control sensor inside the TV, behind the projection screen. That's fine if you're using a remote control from across the room. However, if you want to set up any sort of hardwired remote control system (e.g. a computer controlling all the hardware in your entertainment system), you're kind of stuck because any placement of the IR transmitter that actually works also blocks part of the the screen. The only real option appears to involve drilling a hole in the TV and putting the transmitter inside somewhere. This falls squarely under the category of ""clever tricks that seemed like a good idea at the time"". Guess it's time to drill, baby, drill. *sigh*",4
Toshiba 51H83 51-Inch HDTV-Ready TheaterWide Projection TV,"I recently purchased this TV. The picture was awesome while watching regular programming from DirecTV or watching DVDs. The sound was also excellent - the best I've heard from any projection TV without using a Home Theater system. However, I purchased mine as a ""factory reconditioned"" product which had not been repaired properly and still had a problem when it was shipped to me. I've since returned it to the vendor and am awaiting a credit on my card. Once the credit is received, I plan on purchasing this model once again because it is a great TV. I've compared it to other brands in its price range and also some much higher priced and still prefer this Toshiba. This time, however, I'll purchase through Amazon, brand new, not reconditioned. By the way, the set comes in a big box, which is cut open, removed and then you have a FULLY ASSEMBLED TV which gets plugged in. IT DOES NOT COME IN PIECES. Toshiba is not selling ""puzzle piece TVs."" The guy who says it comes in pieces is either in need of treatment or has a gripe against Toshiba.",4
Toshiba 51H83 51-Inch HDTV-Ready TheaterWide Projection TV,"Back when I purchased this TV, I installed and repaired home theater systems and home electronics. I currently work in the TV industry in Hollywood. I know my TVs. I know picture quality. After EXTENSIVE research on HDTVs and widescreen projection televisions, I bought the Toshiba 51H83. Just do yourself a favor and visit a local electronics store and see for yourself: the picture quality is crisp and vibrant and it stands out head and shoulders above all other rear-projection TVs. While most rear-projection TVs tend to be dark and difficult to watch from angles not directly in front of the TV, Toshiba's proprietary technology is much more forgiving and provides a more immersive experience. Also, the sound quality of the speakers is fantastic. They have great depth and range (something uncommon with most TVs) thank to SRS WOW, which makes a mere 20-watts-per-channel over achieve. I own a 700-watt surround sound system that I now combine with the TV's excellent speakers, thanks to the ability of the TV to use its speakers as the center channel when in surround sound mode. And it, of course, has all the features you would come to expect from a high-end TV (PIP, etc.). I reserved writing a review until I used it for some time, and after almost a year, I'm as in love with it as I was the first day I bought it. Disregard the reviewer who gave it one star, the television comes completely assembled, unless, of course, you buy from the same guy that sells cigarettes from his trunk.",4

This television came COMPLETLY assembled, and with no setup problems whatsoever. I literally set the box down, cut it open slid the top off, shoved the set back into the place it resides now, hooked everything up and it worked FLAWLESSLY. I would bet on the first reviewer not actually owning this television due to the extreme nature of the misinformation he put out there. Rest assured, the picture quality on this set is second to none in its price range, and in my (and from what I have read, many others) eye it has a better picture than sets costing mor in many cases. The setup is very intuitive, anyone with half a brain can get this thing up and running in no time.

I was particularly impressed with Amazon and the shipping company. The Amazon price including shipping was over $300 less than Best Buy's best sales price (with tax).

Toshiba 57H83 57-Inch HDTV-Ready TheaterWide Projection TV,"No other way to put it... we are totally blown away by this tv. The picture quality, particularly when viewing a DVD, is absolutely astounding and the sound from the speakers is EXCELLENT. Consumer Reports top rated this tv and it's easy to see why.",4
Toshiba 57H83 57-Inch HDTV-Ready TheaterWide Projection TV,"This TV is a strong solid performer. It's Consumer Report Magazine's #1 ranked projection TV. It has all the up to date features a HDTV needs ... it has the DVI option for HDTV, has Component Inputs for your DVD player, has S-Video for your satellite or similar, has several standard A/V inputs for your VCR or game system, etc.,. It has everything you need for your basic entertainment system. Additionally the picture quality is one of the best for a projection system. But be weary of that concept, this TV is huge...57"", and with this amount of size, the picture quality on ""smaller"" objects is not going to be super crisp or sharp using even a satellite digital feed. But that holds true on all TVs this big...I think. So for example when watching basketball and you get the half court view the players are not real super sharp ... you can't really see those little details like face features, etc.,. You know it's KOBE but you can't pick up the eyes, etc.,. But for ""regular"" shows that usually don't have such small images, it's wonderful. Toshiba has made the remote and TV use very easy and user friendly. You can easily access video 1,2,3,4 etc.,. for the various electronic components you have. So all good. BUT ... one drawback was the amount of time it took for delivery from Amazon. It took a month although the initial advertised estimate was 1 to 2 weeks. I notice now, though, it says 1 to 2 days, but I notice it's coming from J&R not Amazon and the shipping jumped like $200 so maybe that isn't an issue now. Bottom Line: An overall high quality, full featured, 57"" HDTV.",4
Toshiba 57H83 57-Inch HDTV-Ready TheaterWide Projection TV,"My wife and I were excited at finding such a good TV at a semi-reasonable price ($1900); we had owned a Toshiba 26 inch for 11 years without a hitch. Much like the some of the other reviews, about two months after we bought it; POP! The screen went blank. After a week and a half of waiting, Toshiba sent out repair people and fixed it. They replaced something they called a reflection board. Then, a month later; POP! Same problem. No picture, and now the part is on backorder. No one can tell us when it will arrive. I've been told to FAX a copy of our receipt to them and they will consider replacement. Why do I think that will take even weeks longer? We have a brand-new TV that refuses to work, and Toshiba is being zero help. SHAME on Toshiba for not recalling this piece of JUNK! DO yourself a favor; if you are looking to buy this TV, just keep on looking and save yourself a MAJOR headache!",4
Toshiba 57H83 57-Inch HDTV-Ready TheaterWide Projection TV,"This Toshiba TV was rated the #1 buy by Consumer Reports. This is what motivated us to purchase this TV even though we had read alot of negative feedback from buyers who experienced breakdowns soon after purchase and long waits for part replacement. We shrugged off those reviews by rationalizing that out of the thousands of people who buy this TV, probably only the ones with a bad Toshiba experience take the time to write one. One week after buying the Toshiba however I turned on the TV and when the screen just showed solid green I had the sinking feeling I should have listened to the nay sayers a little more closely. It is two months later and all I get is ""the part should be shipping Monday and then it will be 3-5 business days after that"" followed by ""I'm sorry sir, the part should be shipping Wednesday"", and finally, ""It's not going out this week but we show it should be shipping on Monday"". Toshiba customer service was unable to provide any help at all and they generally don't see a problem with someone spending $2000 for a T.V., using it a week, and then having them wait weeks and weeks to get it fixed. Again, it is a great T.V. if your are willing to risk having it break and waiting months for a replacement part. I would strongly advise anyone thinking of buying a Toshiba projection TV to think twice and read some of the things other people have written. It just isn't worth the frustration",4
